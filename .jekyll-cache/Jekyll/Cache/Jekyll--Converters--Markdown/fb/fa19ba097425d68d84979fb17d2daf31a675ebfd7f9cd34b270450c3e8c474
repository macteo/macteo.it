I"è<p>News, videos, articles, posts, tweets, GIFs, promoted posts, links, periscopes. We are constantly <strong>flooded</strong> by stuff to read and consume. We are continuously pushed to visit new pages, read new articles, play different videos. Every single action we do to consume a different content generates income for the publishers in form of <strong>ads</strong>.</p>

<p>I want my reading time back.</p>

<p>There are at least XX ways to find and consume informations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Newspapers</li>
  <li>Magazines</li>
  <li>Television</li>
  <li>Radio</li>
  <li>Cinema</li>
  <li>Internet:
    <ul>
      <li>Facebook</li>
      <li>YouTube</li>
      <li>Twitter</li>
      <li>Newspaper and magazines websites</li>
      <li>Periscope</li>
      <li>Blogs</li>
      <li>‚Ä¶</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://qz.com/416416/we-now-spend-more-than-eight-hours-a-day-consuming-media/">Quartz posted</a> some interesting charts with shifts between media consumption between 2010 and 2015. The rise of generic internet consumption and consequent television, radio, magazines, newspapers decline is appalling.</p>

<p><img src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/change_in_average_daily_media_consumption_2015_vs_2010_chartbuilder.png?w=640#center400" alt="Rise and fall of media consumption" /></p>

<p>Internet media consumption is increasingly becoming similar to classic Television: you have multiple channels that stream informations to you, with very limited or null interaction. I‚Äôve removed Television from my life several years ago<sup id="fnref:tv" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:tv" class="footnote">1</a></sup> as I decided that I didn‚Äôt like the media: it was sucking away my time, proposing informations I didn‚Äôt want to consume and being nearly impossible to find and enjoy interesting, at least to me, content.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://youtube.com">YouTube</a> with <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6172631?hl=en">up next or autoplay</a> let you just continuously stream video barely related to each other, besides your real initial interest.</li>
  <li><a href="https://facebook.com">Facebook</a> has a magnificent <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/166738576721085">news feed</a> where informations are proposed and ordered by connections and relations.</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> with the new <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/247653">algorithmic timeline</a> fills your with tweets based on people you follow and other sources they think will be interesting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.periscope.tv">Periscope</a> is a just in time app: you stream exactly what‚Äôs happening in front of another person‚Äôs smartphone. Information quality is generally far from great.</li>
  <li>Online Newspapers
    <ul>
      <li>Home pages are typically updated every few minutes to be on the verge, huge titles calling for your attention on what‚Äôs going on at the moment let you open poorly written pieces updated much more infrequently.</li>
      <li>Live blogging with one-two lines posted like a twitter stream to send breaking news updates.</li>
      <li>Promoted content and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_advertising">natural advertising</a>. Basically garbage that generates big money.</li>
      <li>Popular targeted content: cats, hilarious videos, etc stay in the home page for many days driving your attention away from articles.</li>
      <li>Articles ‚Äì finally ‚Äì are mostly relegated inside the paywall and the printed version. The ones freely accessible are usually quite difficult to find as they needs to fight with all the above contents.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôve been sucked in this well in the last few years. I need to emerge and regain access to insightful informations.</p>

<h5 id="alternatives">Alternatives:</h5>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://nuzzel.com">Nuzzel</a> shows you a list of links shared by people you follow on Twitter, sorted by number of shares. Nuzzel includes also newsletters curated by people.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> let people post links, rate and comment on them. Links are also organized by argument (subreddit). The amount of people is huge. Quality of shared content is usually poor and mostly interesting to the masses. Insightful, long and profound articles usually never reach the top of the lists.</li>
  <li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> like reddit but only for technical news.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some ideas to improve the situations are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Editorial curation: experts that look into existing content to tag, rate and sort them.</li>
  <li>Profiles: each</li>
</ul>
