I"ð<p><strong>Since the iPhoneâ€™s advent in 2007 files started to die.</strong>
<strong>With iOS 11 and the iPad Pro they started to be alive again.</strong></p>

<p>File as representation of bits on a disk are obviously doing good and are stronger than ever, however the perception of what is a file or what it contains to the final and generic user is fading away. Itâ€™s still important to digital content creators, but most people donâ€™t have to directly manipulate a single file on most days.</p>

<p>#TODO describe the apps that doesnâ€™t have any file notion</p>

<h5 id="filesytem">Filesytem</h5>

<p>iOS didnâ€™t include a native file management app until <a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/icloud-drive/">iCloud Drive</a> gained an optional and hidden by default app in 2015.</p>

<p>The filesystem and file/folder structure is still there obviously but itâ€™s completely hidden from the end user<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h5 id="safari">Safari</h5>

<p>The web experienced inside a browser mostly doesnâ€™t have the file notion too. Files can be downloaded or uploaded, but on iOS itâ€™s a pain to transfer them inside the desired app<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, and until iOS 9 (available in late 2015) you werenâ€™t able to select anything different than an image from the camera roll.</p>

<h5 id="apps-and-services">Apps and services</h5>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreader.com">Good Reader</a> was one of the first apps that back in 2008 started providing PDF viewing capabilities and file management: <em>open</em>, <em>move</em>, <em>copy</em>, <em>duplicate</em>, <em>unzip</em>, <em>delete</em>. Many other apps followed and apps/services like <a href="https://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> let you browse your files and folders even if you donâ€™t have them available in the local storage. Files are entities that live in the cloud <em>in some form</em> based on the service you rely on to host them.</p>

<p>Informations inside apps are usually saved in a proprietary or at least undocumented format inside a database (<a href="https://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/watchos/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/index.html">CoreData</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/icloud/">CloudKit</a>, <a href="https://realm.io">Realm</a> or just synchronized in realtime with remote services.</p>

<h5 id="the-file-concept">The file concept</h5>

<p>If you ask a 10 years old where you can find a particular photo, youâ€™ll probably get the answer to look inside the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/photos/">Photos</a> app or eventually <a href="https://photos.google.com">Google Photos</a>. The file containing the photo informations, the raster one, basically disappeared: itâ€™s somewhere but we donâ€™t know where itâ€™s stored, even if it probably contains the most valuable piece of information every family has.</p>

<h5 id="the-murderer">The murderer</h5>

<p>Apple is clearly the killer as it has designed an entire OS to hide files from the users, and it became the second most popular one in the world - after Android that adopted the very same principles.</p>

<h5 id="file-limits">File limits</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Everything on mobile works against them.</li>
  <li>Kids are born with</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="service-limits">Service limits</h5>

<ul>
  <li>If something goes wrong, theyâ€™re lost.</li>
  <li>Who owns the information?</li>
  <li>How can I export?</li>
  <li>Lock-in.</li>
  <li>Versions.</li>
  <li>Share.</li>
  <li>Backup.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="notes-for-ios-and-macos">Notes for iOS and macOS</h5>

<p>Notes app, the XXX most used app by Appleâ€™s admission, has been praised by many reviewers as one of the best apps created by Apple with Safari. <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci">Federico Viticci</a> of MacStories wrote a <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/8/">great Notes review</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Notes isnâ€™t just a powerful alternative to third-party note-taking apps â€“ it joins Safari on the podium of Appleâ€™s best work on iOS, period.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notes is based on CloudKit so it doesnâ€™t expose the structure of notes to the end user. Simplicity and ease of use are winning, but the lock-in is really strong as the only export format (on macOS version) is the brave old PDF.</p>

<p>What I consider really interesting is the support of inline attachments besides rich text. You are able to embed links, images, drawings and generic files that will be saved as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/CloudKitQuickStart/AddingAssetsandLocations/AddingAssetsandLocations.html">Assets</a> in the cloud.</p>
