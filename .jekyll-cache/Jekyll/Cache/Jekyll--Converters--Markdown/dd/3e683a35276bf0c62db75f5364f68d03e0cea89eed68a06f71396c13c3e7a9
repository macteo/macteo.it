I"·<p>Iâ€™ll be one of the speakers at the next <a href="https://speckand.tech">Speck&amp;Tech</a> event in Trento on July 27th, 2017.</p>

<p>This is the abstract of the talk.</p>

<h5 id="wwdc---world-wide-developer-conference">WWDC - World Wide Developer Conference</h5>

<p>Each year a city in California becomes the Mecca for developers, journalists and engineers working or passionate about Appleâ€™s products. If you are interested in technology thatâ€™s where new features and improvements for Appleâ€™s platforms are presented, discussed and dissected. In this speech youâ€™ll understand how the conference and related events are structured, why you should consider to apply for a ticket or a free scholarship and mostly learn of interesting gems announced during ï£¿WWDC17, that will be leveraged by developers to create amazing new apps and features used by hundreds of millions of people.</p>
