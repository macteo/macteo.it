I"Þ<p>Few days ago the latest project I worked on in <a href="http://dimension.it">Dimension</a> has been <a href="http://living.corriere.it/tendenze/extra/mart-telegram-google-balla/">promoted</a> by one the most important Italian newspapers. Itâ€™s <a href="https://telegram.me/martmuseumbot">@MARTmuseumBot</a>, a <a href="http://telegram.org">Telegram</a> bot that guides you inside and outside the <a href="http://www.mart.trento.it">MART museum</a> in Rovereto (Italy). The project, codename Nuntius, has been funded by the <a href="http://www.creatifi.eu/eight-companies-continues-in-the-creative-ring-challenge">CreatiFi Ring Challenge</a> and has been conceived and designed by our team, side by side with the Mart museum amazing staff.</p>

<p>The Mart museum is, the name suggests, the Museum of modern and contemporary art of Trento and Rovereto. The permanent collection of the MART contains more than 15,000 artworks, including paintings, drawings, engravings, and sculptures.</p>

<p>You can interact with the bot even from home, but the experience has been tailored for the museum visitors, while walking alongside the exhibits.</p>

<p>With MobFarm and <a href="http://dimension.it">Dimension</a> I had the opportunity to work for the <a href="http://muse.it">MuSe museum</a> in Trento as they adopted <a href="http://explora-museum.com">EXMU</a> since 2013, <a href="http://triennale.org">La Triennale di Milano</a> adopted <a href="http://explora-museum.com">EXMU</a> in 2015, we developed an interactive exhibit that will be unveiled in the next few weeks and theyâ€™re already testing Nuntius too, and lastly <a href="(http://www.mart.trento.it)">Mart museum</a> itself. It has always been a pleasure. Looking forward for the next one!</p>
