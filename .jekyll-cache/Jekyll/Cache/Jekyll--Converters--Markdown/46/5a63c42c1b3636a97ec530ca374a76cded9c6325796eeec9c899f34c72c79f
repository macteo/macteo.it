I"∫<p>Apple in their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/user-interaction/authentication/">Human Interface Guidelines</a> asks developers to avoid using custom Face ID and Touch ID icons:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Don‚Äôt use custom icons to identify system authentication features.</strong> When people see icons that look like the system‚Äôs Touch ID (thumbprint) and Face ID icons, they think they‚Äôre supposed to authenticate. Custom variants of these icons create inconsistency and cause confusion, especially when colorized, displayed at a large size, and presented out of context‚Äîlike as a button label or on an app‚Äôs Settings screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However they don‚Äôt provide such standard assets.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not a designer but it took me few minutes to recreate the Face ID logo.</p>

<p>You can download the Sketch file and png, svg and pdf versions from the link below.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/faceid.png#center320s" alt="Face ID" /></p>

<p><a href="http://macteo.it/assets/data/faceid.zip">Download the Face ID package</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Apple published a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/update-apps-for-iphone-x/">new page</a> dedicated to iPhone X support that clarify their position.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Verify your Touch ID code works for Face ID. If your app currently uses Touch ID, update text strings to refer to Face ID when running on iPhone X ‚Äì for example, ‚ÄúSign in with Face ID.‚Äù</p>

  <p><strong>Avoid using icons to represent Face ID and Touch ID</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you should not use an icon to le users login with Touch ID or Face ID, but prefer a text button.</p>
