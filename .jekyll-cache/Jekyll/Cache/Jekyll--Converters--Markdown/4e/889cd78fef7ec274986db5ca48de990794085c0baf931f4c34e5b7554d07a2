I"u<p>I live in Trento, a beautiful city in northern Italy surrounded by the Alps and I really like hiking, skiing, climbing, camping and broadly being into the wild. What I also like are maps, new and old, digital and made of paper. My two thesis written while obtaining my degrees in Environmental Engineering were both centered on maps and especially GIS applications.</p>
