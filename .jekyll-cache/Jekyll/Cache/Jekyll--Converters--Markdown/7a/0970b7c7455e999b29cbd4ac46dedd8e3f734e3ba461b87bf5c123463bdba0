I"<p>Maps and Apple Music apps in iOS 10 include a brand new way to present modal contents: a floating semi-modal view. Widgets and notifications have been redesigned to be presented with a similar shape.</p>

  <p>Due to beta developer agreement I cannot share screenshots of those features. However you can have a look at them visiting the dedicated <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios10-preview/">iOS 10 preview page</a> on Apple’s website.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the technique used in iOS 8 and 9 to round the corner won’t work anymore: you’ll end up with rounded corners and a transparent background instead.</p>

<p>There’s an <a href="https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/159201#159201">entire thread</a> on Apple’s Developer Forums with motivations behind this change (you need to register as developer to read it).</p>

<p>However the trick is to avoid using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layer.mask</code> on the view that contains the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UIVisualEffectView</code> as subview or on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UIVisualEffectView</code> itself as we used to do. Instead you are supposed to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layer.maskView</code> or, if you just need rounded corners, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layer.cornerRadius</code> property associated with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layer.masksToBounds = true</code>.</p>

<p>I’ve also found that if you try to add an external shadow to the container view’s layer, you’ll end up without blur. The trick is to set the shadow inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">func layoutSubiviews()</code> override method.</p>
