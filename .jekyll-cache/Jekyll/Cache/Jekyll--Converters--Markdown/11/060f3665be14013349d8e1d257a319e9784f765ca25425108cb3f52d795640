I"Õ<p>I love <a href="https://gitlab.org">GitLab</a>, I use it daily <a href="https://dimension.it">@Dimension</a> and I even have an omnibus instance on a <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html">NUC</a> @home for my personal projects and scripts.</p>

<p>For instance our teams are adopting Kanban to optimize the process and we heavily rely on <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/product/issueboard/">boards</a> for issue management. One of the key principles of Kanban is called <strong>visualize</strong> and we would strongly like to customize cards background to immediately recognize different kind of issues between <em>features</em>, <em>bugs</em> and generic <em>tasks</em>.</p>
