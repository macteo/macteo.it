I"Ë<p>Apple all but confirmed that the next MacBook Pro models will be unveiled tomorrow and will include support for Touch ID and a custom bar is going to replace the current top row of keys in the embedded keyboard.</p>

<p>The above image is already on your Mac if you installed the latest macOS Sierra 10.12.1 update. Check for yourself looking at</p>

<p>Besides the lack of a visible physical power button and of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Esc</code> key, <a href="http://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/790977924132433920">Steve Troughton Smith suggested</a> that developers, in order to populate the <em>Magic Bar</em> with custom controls, will need to create extensions much like the ones used in watchOS 1.</p>

<p>This opinion is corroborated by the fact that since august a new target named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">os_bridge</code> is available as part of the Xcode toolchain.</p>

<p>In order to support Touch ID - that requires the presence of a Secure Enclave available only as part of the custom <em>A</em> series custom <em>arm</em> SoC used on mobile devices - on Macs that are running on <em>x86-64</em> Intel processors, Apple is going to embed another custom arm SoC inside the Macs. Probably a new letter will be used to describe those chips like the <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-2/"><em>S</em></a> serie created for the ï£¿á´¡á´€á´›á´„Êœ or the <a href="http://www.apple.com/airpods/"><em>W</em></a> serie for headphones. Iâ€™m going to bet my $1 to <em>E1</em> - Embedded 1.</p>

<h5 id="magic-keyboard-2">Magic Keyboard 2</h5>

<p>All those speculations come nicely together also if Apple is going to upgrade the Magic Keyboard replacing the top row with a customizable display like the one rendered below. This device will enable Touch ID support also on iMac, Mac Pro, Mac mini and Apple TV devices..</p>

<p>All the same principles will apply nicely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Custom E1 SoC.</li>
  <li>Touch ID with secure enclave.</li>
  <li>Extensions are preloaded as happens on watchOS (without too much RAM and battery constraints).</li>
  <li>All the logic will run on the extension directly on the keyboard itself and only equivalent <em>keystrokes</em> will be sent back to the Mac to keep low latency.</li>
  <li>The base interface will be preloaded in RAM on the keyboard to speed up the launch.</li>
  <li>Authentication and Security will be managed directly on the Magic Keyboard, but passwords will stay encrypted on the paired Mac keychain.</li>
  <li>It will also work as external keyboard for iPhone, iPad, Apple TV devices.</li>
  <li>Works with Bluetooth and (already) has a Lightning port to charge and eventually communicate.</li>
  <li>Requires macOS Sierra 10.12.1, iOS 10.1 or tvOS 10.0.1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the really bold prediction: the price will stay the same as the original Magic Keyboard: $99. Apple has already increased the price by $30 last year.</p>
