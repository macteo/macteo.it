I"H<p>In less than a week <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2017/">Apple WWDC’s Keynote</a> will take place and they will unveil some new stuff to 5000 developers (myself included) plus a bunch of journalists.</p>

<p>WWDC – <em>World Wide Developer Conference</em>, as the name implies, is a conference for developers and in recent years Apple unveiled <em>only</em> software: namely new major <em>iOS</em>, <em>macOS</em>, <em>watchOS</em> and <em>tvOS</em> versions. The last hardware announced was the now infamous <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15175994/apple-mac-pro-failure-admission">trash can Mac Pro</a> in June 2013 that was eventually released in December of the same year. The previous year the (<em>at the time new</em>) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012/06/13/apple-macbook-pro-with-retina-display-review/">MacBook Pro with Retina Display</a> was announced and released on the same day.</p>

<p>This year however there are much more rumors than usual on possible new or updated hardware releases.</p>
