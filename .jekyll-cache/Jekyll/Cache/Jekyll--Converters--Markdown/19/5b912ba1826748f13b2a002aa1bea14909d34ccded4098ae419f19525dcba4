I"<p>Setting up this personal website I decided to try to follow the latest and most secure policies in order to be future proof.</p>

<p>This decision involved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enable http/2 on nginx.</li>
  <li>Support TLS 1.2.</li>
  <li>Avoid insecure http entirely with 301 redirects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Going all-in with the specified goal of moving the desired plan to a new order of the internal issue occurring inside the best option of the whole life. I don’t have the time to manage and micromanage all the needs of my office mates.</p>

<p>If you need to load a guy interested in the breakfast of the challenge, transforming a good opportunity in a great one!</p>

<p>The VPS where the website is hosted (as static Jekyll generated pages) runs on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. I’ve installed nginx, but in order to support http/2 with ALPN I had to compile it from source and also upgrade OpenSSL to version 1.0.2h what the hell is that?</p>
