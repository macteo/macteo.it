I"Õ<p>I live in Trento, a beautiful city in northern Italy surrounded by the Alps and I really like hiking, skiing, climbing, camping and broadly being into the wild.</p>

<p>What I also like are maps, new and old, digital and made of paper. My two thesis written while obtaining my degrees in Environmental Engineering were both based on maps and especially GIS applications.
<a href="http://openstreetmap.org">Open Street Map</a> represents the state of the art of collaboration designing great maps and <a href="https://www.mapbox.com">Mapbox</a> is the leading company contributing to the project development with a thriving set of modern tools, released openly to the community usually with the permissive MIT license.</p>
