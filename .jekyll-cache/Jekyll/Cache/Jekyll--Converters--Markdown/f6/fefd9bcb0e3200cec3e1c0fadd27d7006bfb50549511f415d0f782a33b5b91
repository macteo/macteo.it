I"Û<p>Resizable splitted view for iOS.</p>

<p>Today Iâ€™ve released <a href="https://github.com/macteo/splitkit">SplitKit</a>, a sigle file component that does just one thing: let you place two views side by side or bottom to top.</p>

<p>Heavily inspired by the Swift Playgrounds app for iPad, <em>SplitKit</em> gives you the ability to easily present two <code class="highlighter-rouge">UIView</code>s side by side (or stacked one on top of the other) baked by different <code class="highlighter-rouge">UIViewControllers</code>. Everything is implemented in a single <em>.swift</em> file to easily drop it in in existing projects. CocoaPods, Carthage and plain Dynamic Framework are supported as well for your convenience. The end user has the ability to resize the views just dragging the separator like each macOS counterpart, when the drag is performed a convenient handle appears to highlight the resizing operation. If the separator is really close to one of the edges, it will snap to it with an enjoyable animation and the handle wonâ€™t disappear to highlight the hidden view position.</p>
