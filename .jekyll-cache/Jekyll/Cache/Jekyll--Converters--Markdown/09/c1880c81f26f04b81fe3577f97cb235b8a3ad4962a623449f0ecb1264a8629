I"m<p>I’m in love with the new six colors <em>iOS 11</em> wallpapers so I’ve created the larger <em>macOS</em> versions.</p>

<p>They’re available with different background colors (black, white, green, yellow, orange, red, purple and blue) and optimized for 2K, 4K, 5K and 8K resolutions.</p>

<p>You can download them from the link below the two examples.</p>
