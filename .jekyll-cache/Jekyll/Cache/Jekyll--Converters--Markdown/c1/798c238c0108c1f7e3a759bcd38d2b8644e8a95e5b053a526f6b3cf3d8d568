I"Ú<p>Looking for interesting articles and the right informations, despite Google search engine power, is still somehow a not solved issue. In my opinion thatâ€™s mostly caused by the lacking of <strong>human curation</strong> and <strong>accountability</strong>.</p>

<h5 id="scrambled-eggs-receipt">Scrambled eggs receipt</h5>

<p>Take for example a kitchen receipt. You can go to <a href="https://google.com">google.com</a>, search for example for <em>scrambled eggs recipe</em>. What youâ€™ll end up with are many results based on the amount answers the previous users (the ones that looked for the same search query) choose to click on and advanced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">SEO - Search Engine Optimization</a> techniques.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/rate-everything/scrambled-eggs-recipe.jpg#center400" alt="Google Scrambled Eggs Recipe" /></p>

<p>The first one is a <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6229325?hl=en">featured snippet</a>, according to Google:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we recognize that a query asks a question, we programmatically detect pages that answer the userâ€™s question, and display a snippet as a featured snippet in the search results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically is an algorithmically page proposed by Google, based on their inference of your request.</p>

<p>Then there is a result with an image, taken directly from the original website, and interestingly some <strong>rating</strong> expressed with stars and the number of reviews. <strong>Unfortunately</strong> if you go to the <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/perfect-scrambled-eggs-recipe.html">original page</a> <strong>you donâ€™t see any trace of those reviews</strong>.</p>

<p>The third and fourth results do not come with stars count, but the fifth does. The <a href="http://www.food.com/recipe/fluffy-oven-scrambled-eggs-118047">Fluffy Scrambled Eggs Recipe</a> has a whopping 5 stars with 166 reviews. Looking into the page you can also <a href="http://www.food.com/recipe/kittencals-fluffiest-scrambled-eggs-251220/review">find and read</a> all the reviews, accompanied by people avatars.</p>

<p>Ratings are suggested directly by the content provider (in those cases the recipes websites) in the form of <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/reviews?rd=1">custom tags</a> embedded inside the pages. Unfortunately those tags can be easily <strong>manipulated</strong> by the providers themselves. As different websites are <strong>competing</strong> for page visits and monetize with adversing, theyâ€™re <strong>compelled to boost the rating values</strong> to attract more people. To give you a comparison, itâ€™s like if in the App Store or in the Play Store, app developers can decide how many stars to give to their apps. A higher rating likely causes a boost in App installation and purchases.</p>

<p>Real people, in this case wanna-be cooks, are instead interested in <strong>real ratings</strong> as they want to prepare the best scrambled eggs possible.</p>

<p>It would be interesting if a <strong>super partes</strong> rating index could be used to track user reviews, rating and appreciation to mitigate the forged reviews problem.</p>

<h5 id="movies">Movies</h5>

<p>Looking for the <em>best Bud Spencer movies</em> should be easy and you can expect from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=best+bud+spencer+movies&amp;oq=best+bud+spencer+movies&amp;ie=UTF-8">Google</a> at least the same stars decoration seen from the recipes.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/rate-everything/best-bud-spencer-movie.jpg#center400" alt="Google Best Bud Spencer movie" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately thatâ€™s not the case even if <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070215/">IMDB - Internet Movie DataBase</a> includes the right <code class="highlighter-rouge">xml </code> tags on each movie page.</p>

<p>We still can find the best movies visiting the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/list/ls002712620/?start=1&amp;view=detail&amp;sort=user_rating:desc&amp;defaults=1&amp;scb=0.44892377918586135">first result</a> and sorting the list based on user rating. At least thereâ€™s a great website that let us choose based on user reviews what to watch this night.</p>

<h5 id="a-coding-problem">A coding problem</h5>

<p>If you have a coding issue, like for example <strong>XCode 4 Adding a Sub Project</strong> you can safely go to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5784561/xcode-4-adding-a-sub-project/6912914#6912914">StackOverflow</a> and post your question, or just search for it to find out if someone else had the same issue.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/rate-everything/stackoverflow.jpg#center400" alt="StackOverflow" /></p>

<p>People are amazing and want to help each other, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> and many other <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">sibling websites</a> offer a rating system to recognize the right answers and provide the author with points and badges. This way people that need help can easily identify the solution and spend less time struggling.</p>

<h5 id="social-networks">Social networks</h5>

<h1 id="todo-retweets-stars-thumbs-up">TODO: retweets, stars, thumbs up</h1>

<h5 id="medium">Medium</h5>

<h1 id="todo-write-about-medium">TODO: write about medium</h1>

<h5 id="reddit">Reddit</h5>

<h1 id="todo-write-about-reddit">TODO: write about reddit</h1>

<h5 id="everything-else">Everything else</h5>

<p>Wouldnâ€™t be amazing to leverage the power of people and let them <strong>rate and judge any content published on the internet</strong>?</p>

<p>In my humble opinion the internet grew so much that it is now really <strong>hard to find great content as we are continuously flooded</strong> by new articles, new informations, new movies, new stuff.</p>

<p>We are consequently <strong>impoverished</strong> by the continuous struggle to be up to date, to participate in the stream of thoughts on social networks, that weâ€™ve lost the ability to enjoy more thoughtful analysis and timeless pieces.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m <strong>envisioning</strong> a way to <strong>rate and tag contents</strong>, so really <strong>great one can emerge and be found in every moment</strong>, even in the future, not only when itâ€™s produced, written and published.</p>
