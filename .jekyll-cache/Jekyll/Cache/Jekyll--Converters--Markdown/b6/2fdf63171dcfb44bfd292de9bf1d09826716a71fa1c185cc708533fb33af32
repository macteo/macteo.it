I"å<p>This will be my <em>fifth</em> WWDC as I had the opportunity to attend it since the 2012 edition (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/giovatardu">Giovanni</a> that gave me his ticket as he couldnâ€™t attend). Then I won the lottery four times in a row from 2014 to 2017 ğŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸.</p>

<p>To be honest last year I transferred the ticket to my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/matax">@matax</a> so he was able to attend his first WWDC, but I went to San Francisco anyway.</p>

<p>Bragging aside, I have plenty of expectations for this year regarding things to do, people to meet and questions to ask.</p>

<p>Take off is in less than two weeks ğŸ‰</p>
