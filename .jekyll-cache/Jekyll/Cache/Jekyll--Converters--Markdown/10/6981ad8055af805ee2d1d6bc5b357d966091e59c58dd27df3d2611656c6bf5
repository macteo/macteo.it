I"÷<p>Apple in their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/user-interaction/authentication/">Human Interface Guidelines</a> asks developers to avoid using custom Face ID and Touch ID icons:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Donâ€™t use custom icons to identify system authentication features.</strong> When people see icons that look like the systemâ€™s Touch ID (thumbprint) and Face ID icons, they think theyâ€™re supposed to authenticate. Custom variants of these icons create inconsistency and cause confusion, especially when colorized, displayed at a large size, and presented out of contextâ€”like as a button label or on an appâ€™s Settings screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However they donâ€™t provide such standard assets.</p>
