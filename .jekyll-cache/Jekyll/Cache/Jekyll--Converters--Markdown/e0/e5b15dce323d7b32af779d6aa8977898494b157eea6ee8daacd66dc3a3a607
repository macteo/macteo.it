I"<p>I live in Trento, a beautiful city in northern Italy surrounded by the Alps and I really like hiking, skiing, climbing, camping and broadly being into the wild. What I also like are maps, new and old, digital and made of paper. My two thesis written while obtaining my degrees in Environmental Engineering were both centered on maps and especially GIS applications.</p>

<p><a href="http://openstreetmap.org">Open Street Map</a> represents the state of the art of collaboration designing great maps and <a href="https://www.mapbox.com">Mapbox</a> is the leading company contributing to the project development with a thriving set of modern tools, openly released to the community with the permissive MIT licenses.</p>

<h4 id="digi">Digi</h4>
<p>During the last few months I’ve analysed the panorama of digital hiking maps available for my region (Trentino - Alto Adige) in order to replace printed paper ones, carefully designed to help hikers.</p>

<h5 id="those-were-my-base-requirements">Those were my base requirements:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Mobile first: available at least on iOS (as it’s the platform I use, your mileage may vary), better if also on Android.</li>
  <li>Offline: I should be able to go for an hike with my phone with the map cached for offline use to use if for the whole trip even without internet connection.</li>
  <li>Retina images</li>
  <li>Position: should be able to overlay my current GPS position.</li>
  <li>Minimal memory footprint.</li>
  <li>Beautiful: I want it to look great!</li>
  <li>POI: alpine huts, bivouacs, shelters, inns, hotels, belied paths, peak names and altitude, city names, river names, hospitals, paths numbers, terrain coverage, paths scale, camping sites, information signs, parkings, scale, no vehicle admitted signs, rivers, lakes, waterfalls, springs, fountains, drinking trough, wood, altitude, houses, huts, ruins, bus stops, funiculars, cabin lifts, chair-lifts, ski lifts, passes and saddles, hospitals.</li>
  <li>Contours: view elevation lines.</li>
  <li>Hill shades: view mountain profiles to better perceive your surroundings.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="and-few-bonus-points">And few bonus points:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Record my route and save it for later.</li>
  <li>Load previously recorder routes on top of base map.</li>
  <li>Select a path and see the altimetry chart before going along it.</li>
  <li>Search for POIs.</li>
  <li>Use vector tiles to limit data transfer and improve readability.</li>
  <li>Based on Open Street Map data.</li>
  <li>Continuously updated.</li>
  <li>Optional 3D view with mountains elevation.</li>
</ul>

<p>For reference this is an extract of a plain old paper map designed and sold by Tabacco - Sheet 015 <em>Marmolada - Pelmo - Civetta - Moiazza</em> scale 1:25.000 when printed (used without permission from unknown source - few files stitched together), that I intend to use as reference.</p>

<p>– Image</p>

<p>Obviously this paper map lacks many of the basic features I’m looking for in a digital map, however it serves hikers really well.</p>

<p>The very same area, with updated informations, is available also through the <a href="http://www.tabaccomapp.it">TABACCOmapp</a> with a 1,99€ in-app purchase.</p>
