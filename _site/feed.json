Everything is implemented in a single .swift file to easily drop it in in existing projects. CocoaPods, Carthage and plain Dynamic Framework are supported as well for your convenience. The end user has the ability to resize the views just dragging the separator like each macOS counterpart, when the drag is performed a convenient handle appears to highlight the resizing operation. If the separator is really close to one of the edges, it will snap to it with an enjoyable animation and the handle won’t disappear to highlight the hidden view position.Features:  Horizontal and vertical layouts: one beside the other and one on top of the other.  Customisable separator and handle: choose the color you prefer to match your app style.  Draggable handle to resize the views on the fly.  Snap to the closest edge.  Automatically keyboard dismiss if the keyboard top margin is crossed while resizing.  Support iOS 9 leveraging topLayoutGuide and bottomLayoutGuide through iOS 11 and the new safeAreaLayoutGuide.It has been written during a single weekend so it can be definitely improved.Let me know if you find any issue or have a suggestion.",

Many other vendors are offering those kind of maps, however the digital versions, when available, have so many drawbacks that the paper ones are always preferable.Those were my base requirements:  Mobile first: available at least on iOS (as it’s the platform I use), better if also on Android.  Offline: I should be able to go for a hike with my phone with the map already cached for offline use during the whole trip even without internet connection.  Retina screen support.  Position: should be able to overlay my current GPS position.  Minimal memory footprint.  Beautiful: I want it to look great!

Use vector tiles to limit data transfer, improve readability and performances.  Based on Open Street Map data.  Continuously updated.  Optional 3D view with terrain elevation.DesolationThere isn’t any map provider that has realised a compelling digital map fulfilling my base requirements, so the only solution is to understand if I can build one myself.Where to start?Open Street Map represents the state of the art of collaboration designing great maps and Mapbox is the leading company contributing to the project development with a thriving set of modern tools, openly released to the community with the permissive MIT licenses.Mapbox open source contributions  iD Editor founded by The Knight Foundation.  Mapbox GL js Interactive, thoroughly customisable maps in the browser, powered by vector tiles and WebGL.  Mapbox GL native Interactive, thoroughly customisable maps in native Android, iOS, macOS, Node.js, and Qt applications, powered by vector tiles and OpenGL.  Mapbox Navigation iOS Turn-by-turn navigation logic and UI in Swift or Objective-C on iOS.Mapbox commercial products  Mapbox  Maps are based on vector tiles, an advanced approach to mapping where data is delivered to the device and precisely rendered in real-time. The result is smooth, fast maps.  Directions Smart turn-by-turn routing based on crowdsourced real-time traffic.  Mapbox Studio Design custom maps that fit seamlessly in your application.  Geocoding Turn your coordinates into addresses or your addresses into coordinates.  Satellite Full global base map that is perfect as a blank canvas or an overlay for your own data.  Developer Tools native SDKs and remote APIs like Directions, Map Matching, Distance and many more.LimitsThe biggest limit that prevents me to use the OpenStreetMap data directly through the Mapbox platform is that Mapbox exposes a subset of the informations available on the OpenStreetMap database.For example every mountain trail usually has an attribute called sac_scale that based on the reference guidelines can assume different values:  T1 - Hiking: trail well cleared.  T2 - Mountain Hiking: trail with continuous line and balanced ascent.  T3 - Demanding Mountain Hiking: exposed sites may be secured with ropes or chains, possible need to use hands for balance.  T4 - Alpine hiking: sometimes need for hand use to get ahead.  T5 - Demanding alpine hiking: single plainly climbing up to second grade.  T6 - Difficult alpine hiking: climbing up to second grade.Trails should be rendered on the map with different colours and sometimes dashes or points as you can see on the Tabacco map: trails are red continuous or dashed lines, sometimes white if large enough.Similar issues needs to be faced for other mountain routes like vie ferrate or for the seasonality of mountain huts that require different icons, downhill ski paths (piste) are differentiated by difficulty and uphill aerialways should be classified based on their type.Approach and initial resultsIt’s a long way to go and at the moment I’ve only identified the flow to gather the desired informations and render the digital map. The goal is to build on top of the open source tools offered by MapBox combined with the toolchain provided by OpenMapTiles, modifying them as needed. Source data is gathered at the moment from OpenStreetMap and other public sources like USGS SRTM and EU-DEM.I’m releasing everything as open source on GitHub to respect the licenses so anyone can eventually build on top of my work and once the flow has settled I plan to organise the different repos and write a tutorial to replicate the effort.The image below reflects the current results (v0.3) and it’s definitely still lacking many informations, but it’s a start.In order to speed up the development and get better performances I’m using the area with this bounding box 11.90000, 46.27185, 12.19625, 46.69510.Progresses with detailed changelog are available for the reference area over at map.macteo.it.In the second part of this post (still unpublished) I’m going to enumerate different tools and technologies I’m using to render and serve the map.",

The goal is to build on top of the open source tools offered by <a href=\"https://www.mapbox.com\">MapBox</a> combined with the toolchain provided by <a href=\"https://openmaptiles.org\">OpenMapTiles</a>, modifying them as needed. Source data is gathered at the moment from <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org\">OpenStreetMap</a> and other public sources like <a href=\"https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/SRTM1Arc\">USGS SRTM</a> and <a href=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/eu-dem\">EU-DEM</a>.I’m releasing everything as open source on <a href=\"http://github.com/macteo\">GitHub</a> to respect the licenses so anyone can eventually build on top of my work and once the flow has settled I plan to organise the different repos and write a tutorial to replicate the effort.</p><p>The image below reflects the current results (<a href=\"https://map.macteo.it/styles/tralio-0.3.0/#14.1/46.4363/12.0728\">v0.3</a>) and it’s definitely still lacking many informations, but it’s a start.</p><p><img src=\"https://macteo.it/assets/images/hiking-map/tralio-0.3.jpg#center100s\" alt=\"Tralio-0.3\" /></p><p>In order to speed up the development and get better performances I’m using the area with this bounding box 11.90000, 46.27185, 12.19625, 46.69510.</p><p>Progresses with detailed changelog are available for the reference area over at <a href=\"https://map.macteo.it\">map.macteo.it</a>.</p><p><img src=\"https://macteo.it/assets/images/hiking-map/map-zomm-pitch.gif#center100s\" alt=\"Zoom and Pitch\" /></p><p>In the second part of this post (still unpublished) I’m going to enumerate different tools and technologies I’m using to render and serve the map.</p>",

Then I won the lottery four times in a row from 2014 to 2017 🤷‍♂️.To be honest last year I transferred the ticket to my colleague @matax so he was able to attend his first WWDC, but I went to San Francisco anyway.Bragging aside, I have plenty of expectations for this year regarding things to do, people to meet and questions to ask.Take off is in less than two weeks 🎉ArrivalThis year WWDC moved back to San Jose after many years being held in San Francisco, it’s a new location for me and I’ve never been there, so I don’t know basically anything: that’s great!Apple announced WWDC in mid February (earlier than usual) so I took the opportunity to book flights and hotel immediately, hoping to win the lottery, but also knowing that there would have been other conferences to attend like AltConf, Layers and CocoaConf Next Door. I’m usually on budget and this was a pleasant surprise: everything did cost approximately 50% less than usual — 659€ for 6 nights (including taxes) and 596€ for the intercontinental flights. I’m going to flight Lufthansa, United and Canada Airlines, not the best options, but surely the cheapest I could find — hoping to avoid the infamous cabin drag. I wasn’t able to find an itinerary to land directly at San Jose airport as it would have been closer.The first night I’ll stay in a cheap hotel nearby the Airport in South San Francisco as I’m going to collapse immediately and sleep at least twelve hours.For the following nights I’ve chosen a motel really close to the McEnery Convention Center where WWDC and most of the third party events are being held. Reducing commuting time during the week is compulsory to to enjoy it at best.FlightsI’ll take off from Verona - VRN on Saturday 3 at 10 AM to land in San Francisco - SFO on the same day at 7:45 PM after a pause in Frankfurt am Main - FRA for approximately 6 hours. I hope to visit Frankfurt’s city center and grab some Brätwurst with Weißbier.I’m coming from Italy so I have a long flight ahead. Those are the things I’m bringing with me in cabin, if no new bans are enforced:  B&amp;amp;O H6 rev 2 - I don’t have noise canceling headphones as I don’t travel much, but those will do.  AirPods, but I’m really scared to lose them if I fell asleep.  Bundled Lightning to Headphone Jack adapter.  Power Brick.  iPhone 7.  USB-A to Lightning cable.  Lightning splitter to charge and listen at the same time.  MacBook if allowed.  USB-C to Lightning cable to connect to the mac.  A pen to compile the immigration form.  Passport.  Apple Watch.  N26 Black Credit Card.  A small Pillow.  A hoodie.  Comfortable shoes.The MasterplanFor me it’s people first, tech second. Every choice I make is based on who I can meet and what I can get from the available events. There’s only one week like this each year so you should consider every opportunity and be assured: you can sleep later on your way back home.This is my personal list of things I’d like to do.SundayI plan to move to San Jose early in the morning, check-in at the hotel, eventually go to the Apple Store to let them check an iPhone 5s with the battery that’s growing large and bending the screen, then pick up the WWDC badge.At 5 pm I’m going to watch App: The Human Story, a Documentary Screening Presented by AltConf &amp;amp; Layers. I already got the $25 ticket and you should too as 100% of the proceedings will go to App Camp for Girls. You can even watch the trailer online.Sunday night: go to bed at a decent time to reduce the jet lag and prepare for the Keynote queue.MondayEarly morning: Spend few hours queuing around the McEnery Convention Center, waiting for the WWDC Keynote to start, trying to get a decent place in the auditorium. In my useless experience, I  knew that even if you showed up at 6 AM you’ll easily enter in Presidio. New location and everything is unexpected. If I cannot sleep I may even show up really early. Breakfast is usually served inside the auditorium.Morning: enjoy the Keynote at 10 AM!Lunch time: find the room with ethernet cables and download the newly released stuff: Xcode, iOS and macOS betas, documentation, release notes and API differences. Bring your own ethernet dongle as there are chances that you won’t find the adapter suiting your computer port attached to the cables. Don’t even try to download stuff on WiFi as it’s usually unreliable.Early afternoon: watch the State of the Union. If rumors are true and this year we’ll get new hardware announced in the keynote during the morning, the State of the Union will be the real keynote for developers to highlight the news. Don’t miss it.Afternoon: listen to Accidental Tech Podcast live at @ AltConf at 5 pm.Evening: show up for the Relay FM WWDC meet-up @ the Museum of Quilts and Textiles at 7 pm.Night: I’m waiting for the Beard Bash tickets to go on sale, hopefully I’ll be able to get one. I’ve also requested an invite for the Firebase + Fabric party but I’m no one and probably my request won’t be even considered. Alternatively I may also collapse on the bed — let’s wait and see.Tuesday to FridaySessions and labs. After the keynote the full schedule will go online without placeholders concealing newly announced stuff. Take 10 minutes and plan your conference choosing which sessions to attend, which one to skip and stream later (it’s OK!), but most importantly when the labs you need to go will happen. I already have a small list of questions I’d like to ask to Apple engineers, but usually as soon as the new APIs are published that list grows exponentially. I usually choose to skip very crowded and mainstream sessions hold in the biggest rooms like What’s new in Swift, What’s new in Auto Layout and Getting Started with Swift as for example Swift is now open source so we already know what’s coming in Swift 4; more advanced sessions or less mainstream ones are more intresting to me as eventually you’ll get invaluable feedback directly after the presentation if you place your questions to the hosts.Lunch sessions - I usually keep an eye on those as they are inspiring and motivational: usually you’ll be able to be part of something really unique. Those are not streamed nor recorder, so it’s a lifetime opportunity. I still remember the ones with J. J. Abrams telling about Bad Robot, one with Star Wars authors and troopers, one where @plutokiller detailed his reasons to remove Pluto from the list of planets — way before the New Horizons probe took some amazing photos.I hope the catering will be different and lunch boxes will be edible for the first time.Get Togethers recently Apple started planning pop-up informal events during the conference to let you meet with like-minded developers and Apple experts for engaging and motivating conversations around specific topics. Keep an eye on them.TuesdayEvening: The Talk Show Live at 6 pm — tickets still need to go on sale and I’m hoping to get one (I’m relying on Overcast push notifications for new episodes and following @gruber on Twitter). Apple Executives were John Gruber’s special guests during the last two years: Phil Shiller and Craig Federighi. Also interesting (and I already have a ticket) is the Swift Panel with Chris Lattner, Jesse Squires, JP Simard, Kamilah Taylor and Kevin Ballard at 6 pm — location still unknown but will be in San Jose. I’m subscribed to the Swift Unwrapped podcast hosted by Squires and Simard to follow along swift evolution.WednesdayEvening: I got a ticket for the Better Elevation Extravaganza with news and music. There’s also another funding event for App Camp for Girls. I’ve attended it last year but I have to admit I’m not able to keep up with the songs played by James Dempsey and the Breakpoints (tech and developer friendly). Also the event has different ticket tiers with a VIP reserved area that you can join performing a substantial donation.ThursdayEvening: (usually) the WWDC beer bash hosted by Apple, with music, food and beer.FridayMost people leave early but sessions and labs usually go on until 5 pm. Be sure to don’t miss them as most advanced topics will be held during those final hours, like the legendary Crusty 2015 and 2016 sessions.BonusI would love to have a sneak peak at Apple Park but it seems difficult right now as most employees are still working at 1 Infinite Loop. Maybe Apple will organise something there, like the beer bash, but I’m not holding my breath.I’ve already been inside Apple’s current headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop two years ago thanks to @filippobiga. If you are interested and know someone that works there ask him/her if you could visit the mothership. Don’t expect much more than a meal at Cafe Mac and some good talks in the central park. Invaluable for a long time Mac lover.Company Store, in the convention center usually there’s a pop up company store where you can buy pricey Apple branded t-shirts, hats, hoodies, pens, bottles and not so much more. The same stuff is usually available at the company store at 1 Infinite Loop. Keep in mind that common sizes will be on fire on Tuesday and Wednesday. Don’t expect to find something different from XXXL hoodies later in the week.San Francisco. If you’ve never been there you can consider a visit taking the public transport Caltrain: it’s just an hour and fifteen minutes from San Jose.WWDC.family app is an easy way to connect with other developers during WWDC.Parties is a great app to keep up with the events organised by third parties during WWDC week.People I’d like to meet  Federico Viticci as fellow Italian fan of MacStories and Connected to say ciao again after a year.  Stephen Hackett and Mike Hurley of Relay FM as they fulfill most of my spare time with podcasts. It’s a tradition as I first met them when they were part of the 5by5 network.  Marco, John and Casey - a truly great trio that shares with me at least two hours every week!  John Gruber, I’d love to say hi.  Apple Execs – specially Craig Federighi – Hair Force One. You know… selfies.  Many developers I met in the last few years.  Apple employees as their work is totally fascinating to me.  You - I’m eager to know new people every year!StayingFew non obvious things I’m bringing with me: Imodium (after a memorable debacle two years ago), earplugs as you never know where and when you’ll end up sleeping, multiple USB charger with USB-A and C, USA to Italy plug converters, MacBook power brick with USB-C cable, Apple Watch cable, spare dollars for hotel tips.I won’t bring with me the electric shaver as my model doesn’t support 50Hz — 110V power supply and it will be so slow that will grab and pull the hairs instead of trimming them. I usually remember it too late and I’m forced to buy razors at the mall like an animal.LeavingI’m leaving on Saturday morning from San Francisco – SFO to enjoy a final evening with friends on Friday. The trip will be quite long as I’m heading to Toronto – YYZ, my first time in Canada, then again Frankfurt – FRA and finally back to Verona – VRN totalling 20 hours between first take off and final landing. An hour driving will bring be back home in Trento1 with my family 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦.I look forward to have an amazing week and meet you if you are there too.            As I’m currently abroad I’ve realised that I’ll travel in 6 different countries in 15 days like a pro: Italy, USA, Germany, Canada, Slovenia and Croatia. &amp;#8617;      ",

Workouts: running and biking with Strava1.  Hearth rate1 with HearthWatch.  Steps with Pedometer++.  Hours spent standing1.  Active energy burned1.  Minutes of daily activity1.  Sleep with AutoSleep.  Diet (occasionally) with MyFitnessPal.  Routes with Moves.  Time spent on projects with Toggl.In order to see in a single place the collected data I’m leveraging Gyroscope. It looks great and gives some insights, what it lacks though is a way to compare different periods.RescueTime gives you some insights on productivity during working hours, tracking automatically the app you are using (works on macOS, doesn’t on iOS), the name of the open document and website addresses on browsers. Unfortunately I wanted to have a more precise proxy of my productivity, measured for example in lines of code written and deleted, hours spent in conference calls, number of emails sent and so on.I wasn’t able to find something alredy existing and I’m also scared to give all this informations to a third party, so this is what I tried:  Deployed a small VPS with the ELK stack (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana) able to ingest, store and display charts of specially time series.  Created a simple iOS app, with a list of buttons to increase different counters on ElasticSearch.  Developed scripts to collect informations from different remote services sending them to Logstash.  Setup webhooks, i.e. on GitHub, pointing to Logstash to collect actions from different services.  Written Logstash scripts able to read exports of my bank transactions and store them in ElasticSearch.  Created different dashboards in Kibana to visualise and compose all the informations coming from different sources.Unfortunately I wasn’t able to render the picture I desired: a single indicator (sum of many smaller ones) to tell me how much productive I’ve been in a particular day, that can be plotted in a single comprehensive chart.Those are some of issues I faced:* Kibana is a great tool specifically designed for time series. When the information is not clearly representative of just a single moment in time, it becomes useless. It has some charts to choose from, but are not very broad nor easily customizable.* Automatic tracking for some stuff is impossible due to the absence of open APIs.* Manual tracking is tedious, prone to errors and suffers deeply of rapid fatigue.At the moment I’m stuck, I don’t have this proxy and I’m really bored to track things manually so I stopped doing it.Do you have any suggestion?

Extensions are preloaded as happens on watchOS (without too much RAM and battery constraints).  All the logic will run on the extension directly on the keyboard itself and only equivalent keystrokes will be sent back to the Mac to keep low latency.  The base interface will be preloaded in RAM on the keyboard to speed up the launch.  Authentication and Security will be managed directly on the Magic Keyboard, but passwords will stay encrypted on the paired Mac keychain.  It will also work as external keyboard for iPhone, iPad, Apple TV devices.  Works with Bluetooth and (already) has a Lightning port to charge and eventually communicate.

We are continuously pushed to visit new pages, read new articles, play different videos. Every single action we do to consume a different content generates income for the publishers in form of ads.I want my reading time back.There are at least XX ways to find and consume informations:  Newspapers  Magazines  Television  Radio  Cinema  Internet:          Facebook      YouTube      Twitter      Newspaper and magazines websites      Periscope      Blogs      …      Quartz posted some interesting charts with shifts between media consumption between 2010 and 2015. The rise of generic internet consumption and consequent television, radio, magazines, newspapers decline is appalling.Internet media consumption is increasingly becoming similar to classic Television: you have multiple channels that stream informations to you, with very limited or null interaction. I’ve removed Television from my life several years ago1 as I decided that I didn’t like the media: it was sucking away my time, proposing informations I didn’t want to consume and being nearly impossible to find and enjoy interesting, at least to me, content.  YouTube with up next or autoplay let you just continuously stream video barely related to each other, besides your real initial interest.  Facebook has a magnificent news feed where informations are proposed and ordered by connections and relations.  Twitter with the new algorithmic timeline fills your with tweets based on people you follow and other sources they think will be interesting.  Periscope is a just in time app: you stream exactly what’s happening in front of another person’s smartphone. Information quality is generally far from great.  Online Newspapers          Home pages are typically updated every few minutes to be on the verge, huge titles calling for your attention on what’s going on at the moment let you open poorly written pieces updated much more infrequently.      Live blogging with one-two lines posted like a twitter stream to send breaking news updates.      Promoted content and natural advertising. Basically garbage that generates big money.      Popular targeted content: cats, hilarious videos, etc stay in the home page for many days driving your attention away from articles.      Articles – finally – are mostly relegated inside the paywall and the printed version. The ones freely accessible are usually quite difficult to find as they needs to fight with all the above contents.      I’ve been sucked in this well in the last few years.

What you’ll end up with are many results based on the amount answers the previous users (the ones that looked for the same search query) choose to click on and advanced SEO - Search Engine Optimization techniques.The first one is a featured snippet, according to Google:  When we recognize that a query asks a question, we programmatically detect pages that answer the user’s question, and display a snippet as a featured snippet in the search results.So basically is an algorithmically page proposed by Google, based on their inference of your request.Then there is a result with an image, taken directly from the original website, and interestingly some rating expressed with stars and the number of reviews. Unfortunately if you go to the original page you don’t see any trace of those reviews.The third and fourth results do not come with stars count, but the fifth does. The Fluffy Scrambled Eggs Recipe has a whopping 5 stars with 166 reviews. Looking into the page you can also find and read all the reviews, accompanied by people avatars.Ratings are suggested directly by the content provider (in those cases the recipes websites) in the form of custom tags embedded inside the pages. Unfortunately those tags can be easily manipulated by the providers themselves. As different websites are competing for page visits and monetize with adversing, they’re compelled to boost the rating values to attract more people. To give you a comparison, it’s like if in the App Store or in the Play Store, app developers can decide how many stars to give to their apps. A higher rating likely causes a boost in App installation and purchases.Real people, in this case wanna-be cooks, are instead interested in real ratings as they want to prepare the best scrambled eggs possible.It would be interesting if a super partes rating index could be used to track user reviews, rating and appreciation to mitigate the forged reviews problem.MoviesLooking for the best Bud Spencer movies should be easy and you can expect from Google at least the same stars decoration seen from the recipes.Unfortunately that’s not the case even if IMDB - Internet Movie DataBase includes the right xml  tags on each movie page.We still can find the best movies visiting the first result and sorting the list based on user rating.

This blog like many others is powered by Jekyll, a ruby application capable to parse markdown formatted text files and generate a static website.What I’m missing from MacDown is the ability to seamlessly write and preview my posts exactly1 as they will appear on the website. I’m currently able to do it with the combination of 7 apps:  Atom (or any other text editor like MacDown itself) to write the post and  Terminal, to run the command bundle exec guard that launches  Guard that tells  Jekyll to regenerate the pages as soon as the file is modified and saved to disk, and also run  guard-livereload that in combination with the  LiveReload Safari Extension can reload the page in  Safari as soon as a new version is available.What I’m aiming for is to be able to reduce the amount of apps needed to obtain the same result. With just 40 added and 4 removed lines to the MacDown source code, I made a hack to remove from the workflow Atom, Guard, guard-livereload, the LiveReload Safari Extension and Safari itself reducing the needed apps to just three2.    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.Every second MacDown saves to disk the currently open document so Jekyll generates the new version. MacDown also won’t show the internally rendered preview (with custom CSS), but loads the file  generated by Jekyll itself from disk with the proper stylesheet,exactly as it will appear and render in production.I’m really happy with this solution as MacDown already has mostly of the features I need like: ability to hide and show the preview with ⇧⌘H, spell checking (using macOS standard APIs), fullscreen support, scroll sync between editor and preview, custom editor fonts, resizable preview (great to test responsive websites) and quick text search within the document.The features I’m looking to add are:  Proper live website preview (not a hack anymore).  Quick document selector.  Automatically infer the rendered html path from the frontmatter parameters.  Sidebar for file and folders navigation.  Link to open the rendered file on an external website.  Open the currently previewed file in the editor when navigating the site.  Highlight links in the editor and generally improve the editor view.  Customisable buttons to start and stop Jekyll, generate the production site and deploy3 it to the remote server.I’d also like to support javascript and css editing with syntax highlight, but that’s really an optional feature. It would be also interesting to embed Jekyll inside the app bundle to create a self contained solution.I still haven’t decided how to distribute the app, but surely I’ll develop those new features and release them publicly on GitHub. It will be a different direction for the MacDown app so I’m not sure if those features will make sense inside the original app, if they do I’ll try to submit some pull requests. I’ll probably try to contact the original author to discuss a solution if and when those new features will be ready. Fortunately the MIT license chosen by the author is really permissive.            MacDown itself can live preview the document with a custom theme, or you can use Marked if you prefer to use a more capable external application. However using them you won’t be able to preview the page exactly as it will appear on your production website. &amp;#8617;              Full disclosure: I’ve also added Xcode as dependency because to change the file to preview I need to recompile the app, but that’s a rough hack, as I already said. &amp;#8617;              At the moment I just rsync the site folder to my remote VPS. &amp;#8617;      ",
