      "content"  : "I‚Äôm building modern digital map suitable for hiking in the Alps as the existing ones are lacking too many basic features that you usually need if are outdoor in the mountains.The map above is my reference one: it‚Äôs manually drawn by Tabacco and it can be considered the state of the art for paper maps of the Alps. Many other vendors are offering those kind of maps, however the digital versions, when available, have so many drawbacks that the paper ones are always preferable.Those were my base requirements:  Mobile first: available at least on iOS (as it‚Äôs the platform I use), better if also on Android.  Offline: I should be able to go for a hike with my phone with the map already cached for offline use during the whole trip even without internet connection.  Retina screen support.  Position: should be able to overlay my current GPS position.  Minimal memory footprint.  Beautiful: I want it to look great!  POI: alpine huts, bivouacs, shelters, inns, hotels, belied paths, peak names and altitude, city names, river names, hospitals, paths numbers, terrain coverage, paths scale, camping sites, information signs, parkings, scale, no vehicle admitted signs, rivers, lakes, waterfalls, springs, fountains, drinking trough, wood, altitude, houses, huts, ruins, bus stops, funiculars, cabin lifts, chair-lifts, ski lifts, passes and saddles, hospitals.  Contours: view elevation lines.  Hill shades: mountain profiles to better perceive your surroundings.And few bonus points:  Record my route and save it for later.  Load previously recorder routes on top of base map.  Select a path and see the altimetry chart before going along it.  Search for POIs.  Use vector tiles to limit data transfer, improve readability and performances.  Based on Open Street Map data.  Continuously updated.  Optional 3D view with terrain elevation.DesolationThere isn‚Äôt any map provider that has realised a compelling digital map fulfilling my base requirements, so the only solution is to understand if I can build one myself.Where to start?Open Street Map represents the state of the art of collaboration designing great maps and Mapbox is the leading company contributing to the project development with a thriving set of modern tools, openly released to the community with the permissive MIT licenses.Mapbox open source contributions  iD Editor founded by The Knight Foundation.  Mapbox GL js Interactive, thoroughly customisable maps in the browser, powered by vector tiles and WebGL.  Mapbox GL native Interactive, thoroughly customisable maps in native Android, iOS, macOS, Node.js, and Qt applications, powered by vector tiles and OpenGL.  Mapbox Navigation iOS Turn-by-turn navigation logic and UI in Swift or Objective-C on iOS.Mapbox commercial products  Mapbox  Maps are based on vector tiles, an advanced approach to mapping where data is delivered to the device and precisely rendered in real-time. The result is smooth, fast maps.  Directions Smart turn-by-turn routing based on crowdsourced real-time traffic.  Mapbox Studio Design custom maps that fit seamlessly in your application.  Geocoding Turn your coordinates into addresses or your addresses into coordinates.  Satellite Full global base map that is perfect as a blank canvas or an overlay for your own data.  Developer Tools native SDKs and remote APIs like Directions, Map Matching, Distance and many more.LimitsThe biggest limit that prevents me to use the OpenStreetMap data directly through the Mapbox platform is that Mapbox exposes a subset of the informations available on the OpenStreetMap database.For example every mountain trail usually has an attribute called sac_scale that based on the reference guidelines can assume different values:  T1 - Hiking: trail well cleared.  T2 - Mountain Hiking: trail with continuous line and balanced ascent.  T3 - Demanding Mountain Hiking: exposed sites may be secured with ropes or chains, possible need to use hands for balance.  T4 - Alpine hiking: sometimes need for hand use to get ahead.  T5 - Demanding alpine hiking: single plainly climbing up to second grade.  T6 - Difficult alpine hiking: climbing up to second grade.Trails should be rendered on the map with different colours and sometimes dashes or points as you can see on the Tabacco map: trails are red continuous or dashed lines, sometimes white if large enough.Similar issues needs to be faced for other mountain routes like vie ferrate or for the seasonality of mountain huts that require different icons, downhill ski paths (piste) are differentiated by difficulty and uphill aerialways should be classified based on their type.Approach and initial resultsIt‚Äôs a long way to go and at the moment I‚Äôve only identified the flow to gather the desired informations and render the digital map. The goal is to build on top of the open source tools offered by MapBox combined with the toolchain provided by OpenMapTiles, modifying them as needed. Source data is gathered at the moment from OpenStreetMap and other public sources like USGS SRTM and EU-DEM.I‚Äôm releasing everything as open source on GitHub to respect the licenses so anyone can eventually build on top of my work and once the flow has settled I plan to organise the different repos and write a tutorial to replicate the effort.The image below reflects the current results (v0.3) and it‚Äôs definitely still lacking many informations, but it‚Äôs a start.In order to speed up the development and get better performances I‚Äôm using the area with this bounding box 11.90000, 46.27185, 12.19625, 46.69510.Progresses with detailed changelog are available for the reference area over at map.macteo.it.In the second part of this post (still unpublished) I‚Äôm going to enumerate different tools and technologies I‚Äôm using to render and serve the map."

The last hardware announced was the now infamous trash can Mac Pro in June 2013 that was eventually released in December of the same year. The previous year the (at the time new) MacBook Pro with Retina Display was announced and released on the same day.This year however there are much more rumors than usual on possible new or updated hardware releases.I‚Äôve created a simple poll to gather your opinions. You can find it embedded below or visiting Pollover1.You can choose one ore more options and with a single tap cast your vote.Let me know what do you think!  You‚Äôll be able to vote as soon as the Keynote starts on Monday June 5.I‚Äôm hoping for a new iMac with renewed hardware and new design, but it seems that it will be out later this year.            Pollover is a side project, not much more than an experiment at the moment to quickly create Polls and collect opinions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8617;      "

      "content"  : "This will be my fifth WWDC as I had the opportunity to attend it since the 2012 edition (thanks Giovanni that gave me his ticket as he couldn‚Äôt attend). Then I won the lottery four times in a row from 2014 to 2017 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.To be honest last year I transferred the ticket to my colleague @matax so he was able to attend his first WWDC, but I went to San Francisco anyway.Bragging aside, I have plenty of expectations for this year regarding things to do, people to meet and questions to ask.Take off is in less than two weeks üéâArrivalThis year WWDC moved back to San Jose after many years being held in San Francisco, it‚Äôs a new location for me and I‚Äôve never been there, so I don‚Äôt know basically anything: that‚Äôs great!Apple announced WWDC in mid February (earlier than usual) so I took the opportunity to book flights and hotel immediately, hoping to win the lottery, but also knowing that there would have been other conferences to attend like AltConf, Layers and CocoaConf Next Door. I‚Äôm usually on budget and this was a pleasant surprise: everything did cost approximately 50% less than usual ‚Äî 659‚Ç¨ for 6 nights (including taxes) and 596‚Ç¨ for the intercontinental flights. I‚Äôm going to flight Lufthansa, United and Canada Airlines, not the best options, but surely the cheapest I could find ‚Äî hoping to avoid the infamous cabin drag. I wasn‚Äôt able to find an itinerary to land directly at San Jose airport as it would have been closer.The first night I‚Äôll stay in a cheap hotel nearby the Airport in South San Francisco as I‚Äôm going to collapse immediately and sleep at least twelve hours.For the following nights I‚Äôve chosen a motel really close to the McEnery Convention Center where WWDC and most of the third party events are being held. Reducing commuting time during the week is compulsory to to enjoy it at best.FlightsI‚Äôll take off from Verona - VRN on Saturday 3 at 10 AM to land in San Francisco - SFO on the same day at 7:45 PM after a pause in Frankfurt am Main - FRA for approximately 6 hours. I hope to visit Frankfurt‚Äôs city center and grab some Br√§twurst with Wei√übier.I‚Äôm coming from Italy so I have a long flight ahead. Those are the things I‚Äôm bringing with me in cabin, if no new bans are enforced:  B&amp;amp;O H6 rev 2 - I don‚Äôt have noise canceling headphones as I don‚Äôt travel much, but those will do.  AirPods, but I‚Äôm really scared to lose them if I fell asleep.  Bundled Lightning to Headphone Jack adapter.  Power Brick.  iPhone 7.  USB-A to Lightning cable.  Lightning splitter to charge and listen at the same time.  MacBook if allowed.  USB-C to Lightning cable to connect to the mac.  A pen to compile the immigration form.  Passport.  Apple Watch.  N26 Black Credit Card.  A small Pillow.  A hoodie.  Comfortable shoes.The MasterplanFor me it‚Äôs people first, tech second. Every choice I make is based on who I can meet and what I can get from the available events. There‚Äôs only one week like this each year so you should consider every opportunity and be assured: you can sleep later on your way back home.This is my personal list of things I‚Äôd like to do.SundayI plan to move to San Jose early in the morning, check-in at the hotel, eventually go to the Apple Store to let them check an iPhone 5s with the battery that‚Äôs growing large and bending the screen, then pick up the WWDC badge.At 5 pm I‚Äôm going to watch App: The Human Story, a Documentary Screening Presented by AltConf &amp;amp; Layers. I already got the $25 ticket and you should too as 100% of the proceedings will go to App Camp for Girls. You can even watch the trailer online.Sunday night: go to bed at a decent time to reduce the jet lag and prepare for the Keynote queue.MondayEarly morning: Spend few hours queuing around the McEnery Convention Center, waiting for the WWDC Keynote to start, trying to get a decent place in the auditorium. In my useless experience, I  knew that even if you showed up at 6 AM you‚Äôll easily enter in Presidio. New location and everything is unexpected. If I cannot sleep I may even show up really early. Breakfast is usually served inside the auditorium.Morning: enjoy the Keynote at 10 AM!Lunch time: find the room with ethernet cables and download the newly released stuff: Xcode, iOS and macOS betas, documentation, release notes and API differences. Bring your own ethernet dongle as there are chances that you won‚Äôt find the adapter suiting your computer port attached to the cables. Don‚Äôt even try to download stuff on WiFi as it‚Äôs usually unreliable.Early afternoon: watch the State of the Union. If rumors are true and this year we‚Äôll get new hardware announced in the keynote during the morning, the State of the Union will be the real keynote for developers to highlight the news. Don‚Äôt miss it.Afternoon: listen to Accidental Tech Podcast live at @ AltConf at 5 pm.Evening: show up for the Relay FM WWDC meet-up @ the Museum of Quilts and Textiles at 7 pm.Night: I‚Äôm waiting for the Beard Bash tickets to go on sale, hopefully I‚Äôll be able to get one. I‚Äôve also requested an invite for the Firebase + Fabric party but I‚Äôm no one and probably my request won‚Äôt be even considered. Alternatively I may also collapse on the bed ‚Äî let‚Äôs wait and see.Tuesday to FridaySessions and labs. After the keynote the full schedule will go online without placeholders concealing newly announced stuff. Take 10 minutes and plan your conference choosing which sessions to attend, which one to skip and stream later (it‚Äôs OK!), but most importantly when the labs you need to go will happen. I already have a small list of questions I‚Äôd like to ask to Apple engineers, but usually as soon as the new APIs are published that list grows exponentially. I usually choose to skip very crowded and mainstream sessions hold in the biggest rooms like What‚Äôs new in Swift, What‚Äôs new in Auto Layout and Getting Started with Swift as for example Swift is now open source so we already know what‚Äôs coming in Swift 4; more advanced sessions or less mainstream ones are more intresting to me as eventually you‚Äôll get invaluable feedback directly after the presentation if you place your questions to the hosts.Lunch sessions - I usually keep an eye on those as they are inspiring and motivational: usually you‚Äôll be able to be part of something really unique. Those are not streamed nor recorder, so it‚Äôs a lifetime opportunity. I still remember the ones with J. J. Abrams telling about Bad Robot, one with Star Wars authors and troopers, one where @plutokiller detailed his reasons to remove Pluto from the list of planets ‚Äî way before the New Horizons probe took some amazing photos.I hope the catering will be different and lunch boxes will be edible for the first time.Get Togethers recently Apple started planning pop-up informal events during the conference to let you meet with like-minded developers and Apple experts for engaging and motivating conversations around specific topics. Keep an eye on them.TuesdayEvening: The Talk Show Live at 6 pm ‚Äî tickets still need to go on sale and I‚Äôm hoping to get one (I‚Äôm relying on Overcast push notifications for new episodes and following @gruber on Twitter). Apple Executives were John Gruber‚Äôs special guests during the last two years: Phil Shiller and Craig Federighi. Also interesting (and I already have a ticket) is the Swift Panel with Chris Lattner, Jesse Squires, JP Simard, Kamilah Taylor and Kevin Ballard at 6 pm ‚Äî location still unknown but will be in San Jose. I‚Äôm subscribed to the Swift Unwrapped podcast hosted by Squires and Simard to follow along swift evolution.WednesdayEvening: I got a ticket for the Better Elevation Extravaganza with news and music. There‚Äôs also another funding event for App Camp for Girls. I‚Äôve attended it last year but I have to admit I‚Äôm not able to keep up with the songs played by James Dempsey and the Breakpoints (tech and developer friendly). Also the event has different ticket tiers with a VIP reserved area that you can join performing a substantial donation.ThursdayEvening: (usually) the WWDC beer bash hosted by Apple, with music, food and beer.FridayMost people leave early but sessions and labs usually go on until 5 pm. Be sure to don‚Äôt miss them as most advanced topics will be held during those final hours, like the legendary Crusty 2015 and 2016 sessions.BonusI would love to have a sneak peak at Apple Park but it seems difficult right now as most employees are still working at 1 Infinite Loop. Maybe Apple will organise something there, like the beer bash, but I‚Äôm not holding my breath.I‚Äôve already been inside Apple‚Äôs current headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop two years ago thanks to @filippobiga. If you are interested and know someone that works there ask him/her if you could visit the mothership. Don‚Äôt expect much more than a meal at Cafe Mac and some good talks in the central park. Invaluable for a long time Mac lover.Company Store, in the convention center usually there‚Äôs a pop up company store where you can buy pricey Apple branded t-shirts, hats, hoodies, pens, bottles and not so much more. The same stuff is usually available at the company store at 1 Infinite Loop. Keep in mind that common sizes will be on fire on Tuesday and Wednesday. Don‚Äôt expect to find something different from XXXL hoodies later in the week.San Francisco. If you‚Äôve never been there you can consider a visit taking the public transport Caltrain: it‚Äôs just an hour and fifteen minutes from San Jose.WWDC.family app is an easy way to connect with other developers during WWDC.Parties is a great app to keep up with the events organised by third parties during WWDC week.People I‚Äôd like to meet  Federico Viticci as fellow Italian fan of MacStories and Connected to say ciao again after a year.  Stephen Hackett and Mike Hurley of Relay FM as they fulfill most of my spare time with podcasts. It‚Äôs a tradition as I first met them when they were part of the 5by5 network.  Marco, John and Casey - a truly great trio that shares with me at least two hours every week!  John Gruber, I‚Äôd love to say hi.  Apple Execs ‚Äì specially Craig Federighi ‚Äì Hair Force One. You know‚Ä¶ selfies.  Many developers I met in the last few years.  Apple employees as their work is totally fascinating to me.  You - I‚Äôm eager to know new people every year!StayingFew non obvious things I‚Äôm bringing with me: Imodium (after a memorable debacle two years ago), earplugs as you never know where and when you‚Äôll end up sleeping, multiple USB charger with USB-A and C, USA to Italy plug converters, MacBook power brick with USB-C cable, Apple Watch cable, spare dollars for hotel tips.I won‚Äôt bring with me the electric shaver as my model doesn‚Äôt support 50Hz ‚Äî 110V power supply and it will be so slow that will grab and pull the hairs instead of trimming them. I usually remember it too late and I‚Äôm forced to buy razors at the mall like an animal.LeavingI‚Äôm leaving on Saturday morning from San Francisco ‚Äì SFO to enjoy a final evening with friends on Friday. The trip will be quite long as I‚Äôm heading to Toronto ‚Äì YYZ, my first time in Canada, then again Frankfurt ‚Äì FRA and finally back to Verona ‚Äì VRN totalling 20 hours between first take off and final landing. An hour driving will bring be back home in Trento1 with my family üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶.I look forward to have an amazing week and meet you if you are there too.            As I‚Äôm currently abroad I‚Äôve realised that I‚Äôll travel in 6 different countries in 15 days like a pro: Italy, USA, Germany, Canada, Slovenia and Croatia.&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8617;      "

      "content"  : "The quantified self concept and movement represent an area of great interest to improve the knowledge of yourself and a great stimulus to become a better person.At the moment I‚Äôm leveraging existing tools to measure few areas:  Body weight with an old style scale each morning.  Workouts: running and biking with Strava1.  Hearth rate1 with HearthWatch.  Steps with Pedometer++.  Hours spent standing1.  Active energy burned1.  Minutes of daily activity1.  Sleep with AutoSleep.  Diet (occasionally) with MyFitnessPal.  Routes with Moves.  Time spent on projects with Toggl.In order to see in a single place the collected data I‚Äôm leveraging Gyroscope. It looks great and gives some insights, what it lacks though is a way to compare different periods.RescueTime gives you some insights on productivity during working hours, tracking automatically the app you are using (works on macOS, doesn‚Äôt on iOS), the name of the open document and website addresses on browsers. Unfortunately I wanted to have a more precise proxy of my productivity, measured for example in lines of code written and deleted, hours spent in conference calls, number of emails sent and so on.I wasn‚Äôt able to find something alredy existing and I‚Äôm also scared to give all this informations to a third party, so this is what I tried:  Deployed a small VPS with the ELK stack (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana) able to ingest, store and display charts of specially time series.  Created a simple iOS app, with a list of buttons to increase different counters on ElasticSearch.  Developed scripts to collect informations from different remote services sending them to Logstash.  Setup webhooks, i.e. on GitHub, pointing to Logstash to collect actions from different services.  Written Logstash scripts able to read exports of my bank transactions and store them in ElasticSearch.  Created different dashboards in Kibana to visualise and compose all the informations coming from different sources.Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt able to render the picture I desired: a single indicator (sum of many smaller ones) to tell me how much productive I‚Äôve been in a particular day, that can be plotted in a single comprehensive chart.Those are some of issues I faced:  Kibana is a great tool specifically designed for time series. When the information is not clearly representative of just a single moment in time, it becomes useless. It has some charts to choose from, but are not very broad nor easily customizable.  Automatic tracking for some stuff is impossible due to the absence of open APIs.  Manual tracking is tedious, prone to errors and suffers deeply of rapid fatigue.At the moment I‚Äôm stuck, I don‚Äôt have this proxy and I‚Äôm really bored to track things manually so I stopped doing it.Do you have any suggestion? Ping me on Twitter @macteo.

Check for yourself looking at/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PassKitUI.framework/Versions/A/Resources/ApplePaySplashSA.tiffBesides the lack of a visible physical power button and of the Esc key, Steve Troughton Smith suggested that developers, in order to populate the Magic Bar with custom controls, will need to create extensions much like the ones used in watchOS 1.This opinion is corroborated by the fact that since august a new target named os_bridge is available as part of the Xcode toolchain.In order to support Touch ID - that requires the presence of a Secure Enclave available only as part of the custom A series custom arm SoC used on mobile devices - on Macs that are running on x86-64 Intel processors, Apple is going to embed another custom arm SoC inside the Macs. Probably a new letter will be used to describe those chips like the S serie created for the Ô£ø·¥°·¥Ä·¥õ·¥Ñ ú or the W serie for headphones. I‚Äôm going to bet my $1 to E1  - Embedded 1.Magic Keyboard 2All those speculations come nicely together also if Apple is going to upgrade the Magic Keyboard replacing the top row with a customizable display like the one rendered below. This device will enable Touch ID support also on iMac, Mac Pro, Mac mini and Apple TV devices..All the same principles will apply nicely:  Custom E1 SoC.  Touch ID with secure enclave.  Extensions are preloaded as happens on watchOS (without too much RAM and battery constraints).  All the logic will run on the extension directly on the keyboard itself and only equivalent keystrokes will be sent back to the Mac to keep low latency.  The base interface will be preloaded in RAM on the keyboard to speed up the launch.  Authentication and Security will be managed directly on the Magic Keyboard, but passwords will stay encrypted on the paired Mac keychain.  It will also work as external keyboard for iPhone, iPad, Apple TV devices.  Works with Bluetooth and (already) has a Lightning port to charge and eventually communicate.  Requires macOS Sierra 10.12.1, iOS 10.1 or tvOS 10.0.1.Now the really bold prediction: the price will stay the same as the original Magic Keyboard: $99. Apple has already increased the price by $30 last year."

Widgets and notifications have been redesigned to be presented with a similar shape.  Due to beta developer agreement I cannot share screenshots of those features. However you can have a look at them visiting the dedicated iOS 10 preview page on Apple‚Äôs website.Unfortunately the technique used in iOS 8 and 9 to round the corner won‚Äôt work anymore: you‚Äôll end up with rounded corners and a transparent background instead.There‚Äôs an entire thread on Apple‚Äôs Developer Forums with motivations behind this change (you need to register as developer to read it).However the trick is to avoid using layer.mask on the view that contains the UIVisualEffectView as subview or on the UIVisualEffectView itself as we used to do. Instead you are supposed to use layer.maskView or, if you just need rounded corners, the layer.cornerRadius property associated with layer.masksToBounds = true.I‚Äôve also found that if you try to add an external shadow to the container view‚Äôs layer, you‚Äôll end up without blur. The trick is to set the shadow inside func layoutSubiviews() override method.class BlurredRoundedView: UIView {    let effectBackground = UIVisualEffectView(effect: extraLightBlur)        required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {        super.init(coder: aDecoder)        commonInit()    }        override init(frame: CGRect) {        super.init(frame: frame)        commonInit()    }        func commonInit()  {        initLayer()        initEffectView()    }        func initLayer() {        backgroundColor = UIColor.clearColor()        layer.cornerRadius = cornerRadius        layer.masksToBounds = false    }        func initEffectView() {        effectBackground.frame = bounds        effectBackground.layer.cornerRadius = cornerRadius        effectBackground.layer.masksToBounds = true        addSubview(effectBackground)        sendSubviewToBack(effectBackground)    }        override func layoutSubviews() {        super.layoutSubviews()        let shadowPath = UIBezierPath(roundedRect: bounds, cornerRadius: cornerRadius)        layer.masksToBounds = false        layer.shadowColor = UIColor.lightGrayColor().CGColor        layer.shadowOffset = CGSizeMake(0.0, 0.0)        layer.shadowOpacity = 0.4        layer.shadowRadius = 4        layer.shadowPath = shadowPath.CGPath    }}I‚Äôve prepared an Xcode playground to show the final result.Once you know how to achieve the desired result, it‚Äôs really simple. Enjoy."

Install required packages: libtool, automake, autoconf, nasm.  Creates a Universal Binary library with simulator and device architectures.Instructions:  Install Xcode and command line tools.

      "content"  : "I just forked MacDown, a popular open-source markdown editor for Mac as I have a few ideas to improve it to better suit my needs.I‚Äôm looking to add some features that I wasn‚Äôt able to find in any other Mac editor to help me write blog posts. This blog like many others is powered by Jekyll, a ruby application capable to parse markdown formatted text files and generate a static website.What I‚Äôm missing from MacDown is the ability to seamlessly write and preview my posts exactly1 as they will appear on the website. I‚Äôm currently able to do it with the combination of 7 apps:  Atom (or any other text editor like MacDown itself) to write the post and  Terminal, to run the command bundle exec guard that launches  Guard that tells  Jekyll to regenerate the pages as soon as the file is modified and saved to disk, and also run  guard-livereload that in combination with the  LiveReload Safari Extension can reload the page in  Safari as soon as a new version is available.What I‚Äôm aiming for is to be able to reduce the amount of apps needed to obtain the same result. With just 40 added and 4 removed lines to the MacDown source code, I made a hack to remove from the workflow Atom, Guard, guard-livereload, the LiveReload Safari Extension and Safari itself reducing the needed apps to just three2.    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.Every second MacDown saves to disk the currently open document so Jekyll generates the new version. MacDown also won‚Äôt show the internally rendered preview (with custom CSS), but loads the file  generated by Jekyll itself from disk with the proper stylesheet,exactly as it will appear and render in production.I‚Äôm really happy with this solution as MacDown already has mostly of the features I need like: ability to hide and show the preview with ‚áß‚åòH, spell checking (using macOS standard APIs), fullscreen support, scroll sync between editor and preview, custom editor fonts, resizable preview (great to test responsive websites) and quick text search within the document.The features I‚Äôm looking to add are:  Proper live website preview (not a hack anymore).  Quick document selector.  Automatically infer the rendered html path from the frontmatter parameters.  Sidebar for file and folders navigation.  Link to open the rendered file on an external website.  Open the currently previewed file in the editor when navigating the site.  Highlight links in the editor and generally improve the editor view.  Customisable buttons to start and stop Jekyll, generate the production site and deploy3 it to the remote server.I‚Äôd also like to support javascript and css editing with syntax highlight, but that‚Äôs really an optional feature. It would be also interesting to embed Jekyll inside the app bundle to create a self contained solution.I still haven‚Äôt decided how to distribute the app, but surely I‚Äôll develop those new features and release them publicly on GitHub. It will be a different direction for the MacDown app so I‚Äôm not sure if those features will make sense inside the original app, if they do I‚Äôll try to submit some pull requests. I‚Äôll probably try to contact the original author to discuss a solution if and when those new features will be ready. Fortunately the MIT license chosen by the author is really permissive.            MacDown itself can live preview the document with a custom theme, or you can use Marked if you prefer to use a more capable external application. However using them you won‚Äôt be able to preview the page exactly as it will appear on your production website.&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8617;              Full disclosure: I‚Äôve also added Xcode as dependency because to change the file to preview I need to recompile the app, but that‚Äôs a rough hack, as I already said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8617;              At the moment I just rsync the site folder to my remote VPS.&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8617;      "
