Apple fixes another FaceTime bug in iOS 12.2 as well as many other nasty security related bugs.

> **FaceTime**
> Available for: iPhone 5s and later, iPad Air and later, and iPod touch 6th generation
Impact: A userâ€™s video may not be paused in a FaceTime call if they exit the FaceTime app while the call is ringing

Update as soon as possible, if you can.
