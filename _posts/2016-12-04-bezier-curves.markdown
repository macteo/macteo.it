Few weeks ago I had the pleasure to prepare and host a lesson on Bézier Curves during the _Analisi matematica con elementi di algebra_ course, part of the bachelor degree [Interfacce e Tecnologie della Comunicazione](http://offertaformativa.unitn.it/it/l/interfacce-e-tecnologie-della-comunicazione) taking place in [Rovereto](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rovereto).

I'm listing here some existing material that inspired me, and a Swift Playground I've prepared for the lesson.


##### Inspiring sources

* [Bézier Curves - Under the Hood](https://vimeo.com/106757336) video and related [article](https://medium.com/sketch-app/mastering-the-bezier-curve-in-sketch-4da8fdf0dbbb#.rhuvgwcq0) by [Peter Nowell](https://twitter.com/pnowelldesign).

* [Making things with maths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkx1aKv2z8o) by [Steven Wittens](https://acko.net/about/).

Thanks!

##### Swift Playground

Two different versions of the same playground are available, one compatible with the [Swift Playground](http://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) app for iPad, the other with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) on macOS.

> Disclaimer: the hidden code is really rough, I plan to refactor it, but time is definitely a limiting factor.
