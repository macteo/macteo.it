I'm in love with the new six colors _iOS 11_ wallpapers so I've created the larger _macOS_ versions.

They're available with different background colors (black, white, green, yellow, orange, red, purple and blue) and optimized for 2K, 4K, 5K and 8K resolutions.

You can download them from the link below the two examples.
