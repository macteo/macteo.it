I’ll be surprised if we get it so soon.

> “for non-US regions “the ECG app is available on Apple Watch Series 4 with watchOS 5.2, paired with iPhone 5s or later with iOS 12.2 or later”.

A life saving feature coming with a software update.
This is the future.

###### Update

Apple released watchOS 5.2 enabling ECG in many european countries 🎉
