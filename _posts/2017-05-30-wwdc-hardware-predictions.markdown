In less than a week [Apple WWDC's Keynote](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2017/) will take place and they will unveil some new stuff to 5000 developers (myself included) plus a bunch of journalists.

WWDC â€“ _World Wide Developer Conference_, as the name implies, is a conference for developers and in recent years Apple unveiled _only_ software: namely new major _iOS_, _macOS_, _watchOS_ and _tvOS_ versions. The last hardware announced was the now infamous [trash can Mac Pro](https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15175994/apple-mac-pro-failure-admission) in June 2013 that was eventually released in December of the same year. The previous year the (_at the time new_) [MacBook Pro with Retina Display](https://www.engadget.com/2012/06/13/apple-macbook-pro-with-retina-display-review/) was announced and released on the same day.

This year however there are much more rumors than usual on possible new or updated hardware releases.

I've created a simple poll to gather your opinions. You can find it embedded below or visiting [Pollover](https://s.plv.li/wTq1fz)[^1].

I'm hoping for a new iMac with renewed hardware and new design, but it seems that it will be out later this year.
