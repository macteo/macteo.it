            "summary": "",
            "content_text": "I love GitLab, I use it daily @Dimension and I even have an omnibus instance on a NUC @home for my personal projects and scripts.However the lack of interface personalization is driving me crazy.For instance our teams are adopting Kanban to optimize the process and we heavily rely on boards for issue management. One of the key principles of Kanban is called visualize and we would strongly like to customize cards background to immediately recognize different kind of issues between features, bugs and generic tasks.Unfortunately and understandably GitLab doesn’t provide a way to customize that as it would be difficult to generalize, so we came up with a workaround involving custom made browser plugins (Safari, Chrome and Firefox) that injects javascript and CSS in the board pages. Turns out this approach has many issues:  Hard to maintain: each time a new feature is introduced, every plugin should be updated and everybody needs to download it.  Mobile browsers don’t support plugins, so the visualization is inconsistent between platforms.  If someone doesn’t upgrade or install the appropriate plugin she’ll have a second class experience.Turns out there’s a better solution, suggested by Kenn Hermann, that involves injecting javascript and CSS through nginx on every served page.This is what we ended up implementing, but beware that there are security considerations to understand: injecting custom javascript can cause misbehaviors, data leakage or worse1.With this approach we are indeed able to solve every issue we accused using client side browser plugins.Custom Javascript and CSSAll we need is some place to host a CSS file an one or more javascript documents.There are several options, we choose one but you are free to follow other paths.  Create a new GitLab group (in our case we named it public-group) and project (gitlab-custom-ui), setting the privileges to Internal.  Disable the features you don’t need and ensure that everyone has access in file visualization.  Leave the the master branch protected, so only members with at least the maintainer privileges can push on that branch. This is paramount to avoid malware javascript injection by unauthorized users.  Create a custom.css file and custom.js file inside that repository. Those files will be injected on every GitLab page. The external paths will be something like /public-group/gitlab-custom-ui/raw/master/custom.js. Replace public-group with the name of your group and gitlab-custom-ui with the slug of the project, or just copy the proper raw path.A second nginxGitLab Omnibus ships everything needed inside a single package, including the nginx web server. However you are free to put another web server like nginx itself in front of GitLab. This is fully supported.So we installed another nginx instance, adjusted the gitlab.rb configuration and created a public project on GitLab itself that will host the javascript and CSS files to be injected.GitLab configurationOpen the gitlab.rb file and be sure that the listening port is set to something different than 80 if you plan to install the other nginx instance on the same machine. In this case we set to it 8088 and disable https listening as the certificate management is demanded to the other nginx instance.nginx[&#39;listen_port&#39;] = 8088nginx[&#39;listen_https&#39;] = falsenginx[&#39;redirect_http_to_https&#39;] = falsenginx configurationThis is the nginx configuration we used.  Replace gitlab.example.com with your domain.  Configure TLS properly, I highly suggest LetsEncrypt but every valid TLS certificate is OK.  Customize the javascript and CSS injection path based on your needs. We included jQuery as the initial script is lazy, but the it’s completely optional.  Include the mime type override only if needed. We did it just because we decided to use directly the raw file provided by GitLab itself. If you choose to host the files elsewhere and the mime type is properly set, that part is not needed.server {    if ($host = gitlab.example.com) {        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;    }    listen 80;    server_name gitlab.example.com;    return 404;}server {  listen 443 ssl;  server_name gitlab.example.com;  # Your TLS specification below  ssl_certificate /etc/gitlab/ssl/example.com.crt;  ssl_certificate_key /etc/gitlab/ssl/example.com.key;  ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;  ssl_ciphers &#39;EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH&#39;;  client_max_body_size 5024M;  location / {    # We inject three files on every html returned by GitLab    # * custom.css    # * jQuery from a CDN    # * custom.js    sub_filter &#39;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&#39; &#39;\n&amp;lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; media=&quot;all&quot; href=&quot;/public-group/gitlab-custom-ui/raw/master/custom.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;script src=&quot;https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js&quot; integrity=&quot;sha256-3edrmyuQ0w65f8gfBsqowzjJe2iM6n0nKciPUp8y+7E=&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/public-group/gitlab-custom-ui/raw/master/custom.js&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&#39;;    # The GitLab istante IP and listening port    # You also need to change the GitLab listening port from 80 to 8088    proxy_pass http://10.10.1.4:8088;    proxy_set_header   Host $host;    proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP $remote_addr;    proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;    proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Host $server_name;    proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto   https;    # Overriding the mime type of the raw javascript so it can be executed.    # This is necessary    if ($request_uri ~* /public-group/gitlab-custom-ui/raw/master/custom.js$) {      add_header Content-Type &quot;text/javascript&quot;;    }  }}Colored cards backgroundThis the lazy javascript we wrote to add background customization based on the labels assigned to each single issue, narrow the width of each column and enlarge the avatars.In particular if the card includes a label containing a the feature word it will be green, bugs will red and tasks yellow.&#39;use strict&#39;;document.addEventListener(&quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;, function (event) {  (function () {    if (window.top === window) {      function addStyleString(str) {        var node = document.createElement(&#39;style&#39;);        node.innerHTML = str;        document.body.appendChild(node);      }      function setListWidth(str) {        localStorage.setItem(&#39;gitlab-list-width&#39;, str);        addStyleString(&#39;.board {width: &#39; + width + &#39;px;}&#39;);      }      // Improves the board styles: narrower columns, bigger avatars, colored cards.      if (window.location.pathname.indexOf(&quot;/boards&quot;) &amp;gt; -1) {        var width = localStorage.getItem(&#39;gitlab-list-width&#39;);        if (width &amp;amp;&amp;amp; width &amp;lt; 50) {          width = 50;        } else if (width == null) {          width = 235;        }        addStyleString(&#39;.board {width: &#39; + width + &#39;px;}&#39;);        addStyleString(&#39;img.avatar.s24 {width: 32px; height:32px;}&#39;);        addStyleString(&#39;.board-card.feature {background-color: #ECF9DE; }&#39;);        addStyleString(&#39;.board-card.task {background-color: #FEFBDA; }&#39;);        addStyleString(&#39;.board-card.bug {background-color: #F8D9DD; }&#39;);        window.setInterval(function () {          $(&quot;li.board-card&quot;).each(function (index) {            var match = $(this).text().match(/feature/g);            if (match &amp;amp;&amp;amp; match.length &amp;gt; 0) {              $(this).addClass(&#39;feature&#39;);              $(this).removeClass(&#39;bug&#39;);              $(this).removeClass(&#39;task&#39;);            }            match = $(this).text().match(/task/g);            if (match &amp;amp;&amp;amp; match.length &amp;gt; 0) {              $(this).addClass(&#39;task&#39;);              $(this).removeClass(&#39;bug&#39;);              $(this).removeClass(&#39;fature&#39;);            }            match = $(this).text().match(/bug/g);            if (match &amp;amp;&amp;amp; match.length &amp;gt; 0) {              $(this).addClass(&#39;bug&#39;);              $(this).removeClass(&#39;task&#39;);              $(this).removeClass(&#39;feature&#39;);            }          });        }     }  })();});This is just a suggestion, the javascript can be surely optimized and with this approach you can add more features.Final board appearanceIf the solution in generalized enough you can even try propose merge it in the GitLab source code so everyone can benefit.            Crypto mining in browsers can be an idea… &amp;#8617;      ",

Everything is implemented in a single .swift file to easily drop it in in existing projects. CocoaPods, Carthage and plain Dynamic Framework are supported as well for your convenience. The end user has the ability to resize the views just dragging the separator like each macOS counterpart, when the drag is performed a convenient handle appears to highlight the resizing operation. If the separator is really close to one of the edges, it will snap to it with an enjoyable animation and the handle won’t disappear to highlight the hidden view position.Features:  Horizontal and vertical layouts: one beside the other and one on top of the other.  Customisable separator and handle: choose the color you prefer to match your app style.  Draggable handle to resize the views on the fly.  Snap to the closest edge.  Automatically keyboard dismiss if the keyboard top margin is crossed while resizing.  Support iOS 9 leveraging topLayoutGuide and bottomLayoutGuide through iOS 11 and the new safeAreaLayoutGuide.It has been written during a single weekend so it can be definitely improved.Let me know if you find any issue or have a suggestion.",

If the separator is really close to one of the edges, it will snap to it with an enjoyable animation and the handle won’t disappear to highlight the hidden view position.</p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macteo/splitkit/master/Assets/GIFs/splitkit.gif#center100s\" alt=\"SplitKit GIF\" /></p><h2 id=\"features\">Features:</h2><ul>  <li>Horizontal and vertical layouts: one beside the other and one on top of the other.</li>  <li>Customisable separator and handle: choose the color you prefer to match your app style.</li>  <li>Draggable handle to resize the views on the fly.</li>  <li>Snap to the closest edge.</li>  <li>Automatically keyboard dismiss if the keyboard top margin is crossed while resizing.</li>  <li>Support iOS 9 leveraging <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">topLayoutGuide</code> and <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">bottomLayoutGuide</code> through iOS 11 and the new <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">safeAreaLayoutGuide</code>.</li></ul><p>It has been written during a single weekend so it can be definitely improved.</p><p>Let me know if you find any issue or have a suggestion.</p>",

Many other vendors are offering those kind of maps, however the digital versions, when available, have so many drawbacks that the paper ones are always preferable.Those were my base requirements:  Mobile first: available at least on iOS (as it’s the platform I use), better if also on Android.  Offline: I should be able to go for a hike with my phone with the map already cached for offline use during the whole trip even without internet connection.  Retina screen support.  Position: should be able to overlay my current GPS position.  Minimal memory footprint.  Beautiful: I want it to look great!

Contours: view elevation lines.  Hill shades: mountain profiles to better perceive your surroundings.And few bonus points:  Record my route and save it for later.  Load previously recorder routes on top of base map.  Select a path and see the altimetry chart before going along it.  Search for POIs.  Use vector tiles to limit data transfer, improve readability and performances.  Based on Open Street Map data.  Continuously updated.  Optional 3D view with terrain elevation.DesolationThere isn’t any map provider that has realised a compelling digital map fulfilling my base requirements, so the only solution is to understand if I can build one myself.Where to start?Open Street Map represents the state of the art of collaboration designing great maps and Mapbox is the leading company contributing to the project development with a thriving set of modern tools, openly released to the community with the permissive MIT licenses.Mapbox open source contributions  iD Editor founded by The Knight Foundation.  Mapbox GL js Interactive, thoroughly customisable maps in the browser, powered by vector tiles and WebGL.  Mapbox GL native Interactive, thoroughly customisable maps in native Android, iOS, macOS, Node.js, and Qt applications, powered by vector tiles and OpenGL.  Mapbox Navigation iOS Turn-by-turn navigation logic and UI in Swift or Objective-C on iOS.Mapbox commercial products  Mapbox Maps are based on vector tiles, an advanced approach to mapping where data is delivered to the device and precisely rendered in real-time. The result is smooth, fast maps.  Directions Smart turn-by-turn routing based on crowdsourced real-time traffic.  Mapbox Studio Design custom maps that fit seamlessly in your application.  Geocoding Turn your coordinates into addresses or your addresses into coordinates.  Satellite Full global base map that is perfect as a blank canvas or an overlay for your own data.  Developer Tools native SDKs and remote APIs like Directions, Map Matching, Distance and many more.LimitsThe biggest limit that prevents me to use the OpenStreetMap data directly through the Mapbox platform is that Mapbox exposes a subset of the informations available on the OpenStreetMap database.For example every mountain trail usually has an attribute called sac_scale that based on the reference guidelines can assume different values:  T1 - Hiking: trail well cleared.  T2 - Mountain Hiking: trail with continuous line and balanced ascent.  T3 - Demanding Mountain Hiking: exposed sites may be secured with ropes or chains, possible need to use hands for balance.  T4 - Alpine hiking: sometimes need for hand use to get ahead.  T5 - Demanding alpine hiking: single plainly climbing up to second grade.  T6 - Difficult alpine hiking: climbing up to second grade.Trails should be rendered on the map with different colours and sometimes dashes or points as you can see on the Tabacco map: trails are red continuous or dashed lines, sometimes white if large enough.Similar issues needs to be faced for other mountain routes like vie ferrate or for the seasonality of mountain huts that require different icons, downhill ski paths (piste) are differentiated by difficulty and uphill aerialways should be classified based on their type.Approach and initial resultsIt’s a long way to go and at the moment I’ve only identified the flow to gather the desired informations and render the digital map. The goal is to build on top of the open source tools offered by MapBox combined with the toolchain provided by OpenMapTiles, modifying them as needed. Source data is gathered at the moment from OpenStreetMap and other public sources like USGS SRTM and EU-DEM.I’m releasing everything as open source on GitHub to respect the licenses so anyone can eventually build on top of my work and once the flow has settled I plan to organise the different repos and write a tutorial to replicate the effort.The image below reflects the current results (v0.3) and it’s definitely still lacking many informations, but it’s a start.In order to speed up the development and get better performances I’m using the area with this bounding box 11.90000, 46.27185, 12.19625, 46.69510.Progresses with detailed changelog are available for the reference area over at map.macteo.it.In the second part of this post (still unpublished) I’m going to enumerate different tools and technologies I’m using to render and serve the map.",

Then I won the lottery four times in a row from 2014 to 2017 🤷‍♂️.To be honest last year I transferred the ticket to my colleague @matax so he was able to attend his first WWDC, but I went to San Francisco anyway.Bragging aside, I have plenty of expectations for this year regarding things to do, people to meet and questions to ask.Take off is in less than two weeks 🎉ArrivalThis year WWDC moved back to San Jose after many years being held in San Francisco, it’s a new location for me and I’ve never been there, so I don’t know basically anything: that’s great!Apple announced WWDC in mid February (earlier than usual) so I took the opportunity to book flights and hotel immediately, hoping to win the lottery, but also knowing that there would have been other conferences to attend like AltConf, Layers and CocoaConf Next Door. I’m usually on budget and this was a pleasant surprise: everything did cost approximately 50% less than usual — 659€ for 6 nights (including taxes) and 596€ for the intercontinental flights. I’m going to flight Lufthansa, United and Canada Airlines, not the best options, but surely the cheapest I could find — hoping to avoid the infamous cabin drag. I wasn’t able to find an itinerary to land directly at San Jose airport as it would have been closer.The first night I’ll stay in a cheap hotel nearby the Airport in South San Francisco as I’m going to collapse immediately and sleep at least twelve hours.For the following nights I’ve chosen a motel really close to the McEnery Convention Center where WWDC and most of the third party events are being held. Reducing commuting time during the week is compulsory to to enjoy it at best.FlightsI’ll take off from Verona - VRN on Saturday 3 at 10 AM to land in San Francisco - SFO on the same day at 7:45 PM after a pause in Frankfurt am Main - FRA for approximately 6 hours. I hope to visit Frankfurt’s city center and grab some Brätwurst with Weißbier.I’m coming from Italy so I have a long flight ahead. Those are the things I’m bringing with me in cabin, if no new bans are enforced:  B&amp;amp;O H6 rev 2 - I don’t have noise canceling headphones as I don’t travel much, but those will do.  AirPods, but I’m really scared to lose them if I fell asleep.  Bundled Lightning to Headphone Jack adapter.  Power Brick.  iPhone 7.  USB-A to Lightning cable.  Lightning splitter to charge and listen at the same time.  MacBook if allowed.  USB-C to Lightning cable to connect to the mac.  A pen to compile the immigration form.  Passport.  Apple Watch.  N26 Black Credit Card.  A small Pillow.  A hoodie.  Comfortable shoes.The MasterplanFor me it’s people first, tech second. Every choice I make is based on who I can meet and what I can get from the available events. There’s only one week like this each year so you should consider every opportunity and be assured: you can sleep later on your way back home.This is my personal list of things I’d like to do.SundayI plan to move to San Jose early in the morning, check-in at the hotel, eventually go to the Apple Store to let them check an iPhone 5s with the battery that’s growing large and bending the screen, then pick up the WWDC badge.At 5 pm I’m going to watch App: The Human Story, a Documentary Screening Presented by AltConf &amp;amp; Layers. I already got the $25 ticket and you should too as 100% of the proceedings will go to App Camp for Girls. You can even watch the trailer online.Sunday night: go to bed at a decent time to reduce the jet lag and prepare for the Keynote queue.MondayEarly morning: Spend few hours queuing around the McEnery Convention Center, waiting for the WWDC Keynote to start, trying to get a decent place in the auditorium. In my useless experience, I knew that even if you showed up at 6 AM you’ll easily enter in Presidio. New location and everything is unexpected. If I cannot sleep I may even show up really early. Breakfast is usually served inside the auditorium.Morning: enjoy the Keynote at 10 AM!Lunch time: find the room with ethernet cables and download the newly released stuff: Xcode, iOS and macOS betas, documentation, release notes and API differences. Bring your own ethernet dongle as there are chances that you won’t find the adapter suiting your computer port attached to the cables. Don’t even try to download stuff on WiFi as it’s usually unreliable.Early afternoon: watch the State of the Union. If rumors are true and this year we’ll get new hardware announced in the keynote during the morning, the State of the Union will be the real keynote for developers to highlight the news. Don’t miss it.Afternoon: listen to Accidental Tech Podcast live at @ AltConf at 5 pm.Evening: show up for the Relay FM WWDC meet-up @ the Museum of Quilts and Textiles at 7 pm.Night: I’m waiting for the Beard Bash tickets to go on sale, hopefully I’ll be able to get one. I’ve also requested an invite for the Firebase + Fabric party but I’m no one and probably my request won’t be even considered. Alternatively I may also collapse on the bed — let’s wait and see.Tuesday to FridaySessions and labs. After the keynote the full schedule will go online without placeholders concealing newly announced stuff. Take 10 minutes and plan your conference choosing which sessions to attend, which one to skip and stream later (it’s OK!), but most importantly when the labs you need to go will happen. I already have a small list of questions I’d like to ask to Apple engineers, but usually as soon as the new APIs are published that list grows exponentially. I usually choose to skip very crowded and mainstream sessions hold in the biggest rooms like What’s new in Swift, What’s new in Auto Layout and Getting Started with Swift as for example Swift is now open source so we already know what’s coming in Swift 4; more advanced sessions or less mainstream ones are more intresting to me as eventually you’ll get invaluable feedback directly after the presentation if you place your questions to the hosts.Lunch sessions - I usually keep an eye on those as they are inspiring and motivational: usually you’ll be able to be part of something really unique. Those are not streamed nor recorder, so it’s a lifetime opportunity. I still remember the ones with J. J. Abrams telling about Bad Robot, one with Star Wars authors and troopers, one where @plutokiller detailed his reasons to remove Pluto from the list of planets — way before the New Horizons probe took some amazing photos.I hope the catering will be different and lunch boxes will be edible for the first time.Get Togethers recently Apple started planning pop-up informal events during the conference to let you meet with like-minded developers and Apple experts for engaging and motivating conversations around specific topics. Keep an eye on them.TuesdayEvening: The Talk Show Live at 6 pm — tickets still need to go on sale and I’m hoping to get one (I’m relying on Overcast push notifications for new episodes and following @gruber on Twitter). Apple Executives were John Gruber’s special guests during the last two years: Phil Shiller and Craig Federighi. Also interesting (and I already have a ticket) is the Swift Panel with Chris Lattner, Jesse Squires, JP Simard, Kamilah Taylor and Kevin Ballard at 6 pm — location still unknown but will be in San Jose. I’m subscribed to the Swift Unwrapped podcast hosted by Squires and Simard to follow along swift evolution.WednesdayEvening: I got a ticket for the Better Elevation Extravaganza with news and music. There’s also another funding event for App Camp for Girls. I’ve attended it last year but I have to admit I’m not able to keep up with the songs played by James Dempsey and the Breakpoints (tech and developer friendly). Also the event has different ticket tiers with a VIP reserved area that you can join performing a substantial donation.ThursdayEvening: (usually) the WWDC beer bash hosted by Apple, with music, food and beer.FridayMost people leave early but sessions and labs usually go on until 5 pm. Be sure to don’t miss them as most advanced topics will be held during those final hours, like the legendary Crusty 2015 and 2016 sessions.BonusI would love to have a sneak peak at Apple Park but it seems difficult right now as most employees are still working at 1 Infinite Loop. Maybe Apple will organise something there, like the beer bash, but I’m not holding my breath.I’ve already been inside Apple’s current headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop two years ago thanks to @filippobiga. If you are interested and know someone that works there ask him/her if you could visit the mothership. Don’t expect much more than a meal at Cafe Mac and some good talks in the central park. Invaluable for a long time Mac lover.Company Store, in the convention center usually there’s a pop up company store where you can buy pricey Apple branded t-shirts, hats, hoodies, pens, bottles and not so much more. The same stuff is usually available at the company store at 1 Infinite Loop. Keep in mind that common sizes will be on fire on Tuesday and Wednesday. Don’t expect to find something different from XXXL hoodies later in the week.San Francisco. If you’ve never been there you can consider a visit taking the public transport Caltrain: it’s just an hour and fifteen minutes from San Jose.WWDC.family app is an easy way to connect with other developers during WWDC.Parties is a great app to keep up with the events organised by third parties during WWDC week.People I’d like to meet  Federico Viticci as fellow Italian fan of MacStories and Connected to say ciao again after a year.  Stephen Hackett and Mike Hurley of Relay FM as they fulfill most of my spare time with podcasts. It’s a tradition as I first met them when they were part of the 5by5 network.  Marco, John and Casey - a truly great trio that shares with me at least two hours every week!  John Gruber, I’d love to say hi.  Apple Execs – specially Craig Federighi – Hair Force One. You know… selfies.  Many developers I met in the last few years.  Apple employees as their work is totally fascinating to me.  You - I’m eager to know new people every year!StayingFew non obvious things I’m bringing with me: Imodium (after a memorable debacle two years ago), earplugs as you never know where and when you’ll end up sleeping, multiple USB charger with USB-A and C, USA to Italy plug converters, MacBook power brick with USB-C cable, Apple Watch cable, spare dollars for hotel tips.I won’t bring with me the electric shaver as my model doesn’t support 50Hz — 110V power supply and it will be so slow that will grab and pull the hairs instead of trimming them. I usually remember it too late and I’m forced to buy razors at the mall like an animal.LeavingI’m leaving on Saturday morning from San Francisco – SFO to enjoy a final evening with friends on Friday. The trip will be quite long as I’m heading to Toronto – YYZ, my first time in Canada, then again Frankfurt – FRA and finally back to Verona – VRN totalling 20 hours between first take off and final landing. An hour driving will bring be back home in Trento1 with my family 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦.I look forward to have an amazing week and meet you if you are there too.            As I’m currently abroad I’ve realised that I’ll travel in 6 different countries in 15 days like a pro: Italy, USA, Germany, Canada, Slovenia and Croatia. &amp;#8617;      ",

When the information is not clearly representative of just a single moment in time, it becomes useless. It has some charts to choose from, but are not very broad nor easily customizable.

Install required packages: libtool, automake, autoconf, nasm.  Creates a Universal Binary library with simulator and device architectures.Instructions:  Install Xcode and command line tools.  Install Homebrew on your Mac.

This blog like many others is powered by Jekyll, a ruby application capable to parse markdown formatted text files and generate a static website.What I’m missing from MacDown is the ability to seamlessly write and preview my posts exactly1 as they will appear on the website. I’m currently able to do it with the combination of 7 apps:  Atom (or any other text editor like MacDown itself) to write the post and  Terminal, to run the command bundle exec guard that launches  Guard that tells  Jekyll to regenerate the pages as soon as the file is modified and saved to disk, and also run  guard-livereload that in combination with the  LiveReload Safari Extension can reload the page in  Safari as soon as a new version is available.What I’m aiming for is to be able to reduce the amount of apps needed to obtain the same result. With just 40 added and 4 removed lines to the MacDown source code, I made a hack to remove from the workflow Atom, Guard, guard-livereload, the LiveReload Safari Extension and Safari itself reducing the needed apps to just three2.    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.Every second MacDown saves to disk the currently open document so Jekyll generates the new version. MacDown also won’t show the internally rendered preview (with custom CSS), but loads the file generated by Jekyll itself from disk with the proper stylesheet,exactly as it will appear and render in production.I’m really happy with this solution as MacDown already has mostly of the features I need like: ability to hide and show the preview with ⇧⌘H, spell checking (using macOS standard APIs), fullscreen support, scroll sync between editor and preview, custom editor fonts, resizable preview (great to test responsive websites) and quick text search within the document.The features I’m looking to add are:  Proper live website preview (not a hack anymore).  Quick document selector.  Automatically infer the rendered html path from the frontmatter parameters.  Sidebar for file and folders navigation.  Link to open the rendered file on an external website.  Open the currently previewed file in the editor when navigating the site.  Highlight links in the editor and generally improve the editor view.  Customisable buttons to start and stop Jekyll, generate the production site and deploy3 it to the remote server.I’d also like to support javascript and css editing with syntax highlight, but that’s really an optional feature. It would be also interesting to embed Jekyll inside the app bundle to create a self contained solution.I still haven’t decided how to distribute the app, but surely I’ll develop those new features and release them publicly on GitHub. It will be a different direction for the MacDown app so I’m not sure if those features will make sense inside the original app, if they do I’ll try to submit some pull requests. I’ll probably try to contact the original author to discuss a solution if and when those new features will be ready. Fortunately the MIT license chosen by the author is really permissive.            MacDown itself can live preview the document with a custom theme, or you can use Marked if you prefer to use a more capable external application. However using them you won’t be able to preview the page exactly as it will appear on your production website. &amp;#8617;              Full disclosure: I’ve also added Xcode as dependency because to change the file to preview I need to recompile the app, but that’s a rough hack, as I already said. &amp;#8617;              At the moment I just rsync the site folder to my remote VPS. &amp;#8617;      ",
